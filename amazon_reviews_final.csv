Praggya, 6 October 2019,After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals I bought Oneplus7t. Pls note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone social media blogging and vlogging etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants it has joined the league of Samsung Mi Oppo Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40000 on it. No camera quality no battery life no sound quality on calls getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.,"4,993",Think and evaluate before you go for it,3.0

manikanta, 2 October 2019,I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.,735,One Plus 7T - One Word STUNNING!!,5.0

Rajesh Adhikary, 2 October 2019,This phone has great performance good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?,747,Pro Camera performance looks. Cons Battery drain and heating up issues,4.0
Piyush Vaibhav, 5 October 2019,I am among the first to buy this phone with prime membership. Posting this review after a week of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos providedone without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.,253,I think an all rounder!,5.0
KESH, 10 October 2019,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,238,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.,1.0

But Bluetooth connection is also good/stable.,165,Good phone,5.0
Nitish Kumar, 3 October 2019,The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn't require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes. It gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue. The battery back up is just pathetic. Not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price OnePlus is selling this device. If option available I would have asked for refund.,138,Not recommended at all,1.0

SHASWAT S., 22 October 2019, I am uploading a video and image watch it before but itDon't waste your money on this phone @this price range.Many customers faces same as I am facing the issue of screen flickering while watching videos specially YouTube.. if u do not noticed now notice it on the upper side where the notch is setup. Play YouTube u can see when u do for full screen and again normal.I am purchased it but thanks to Amazon they replaced it but again same issue 'screen flickering' and again thanks to Amazon they approve my return and now I get my refund..But seriously this device is not too good at this price. So pls don't waste your money.And OnePlus with u never expect like this.,84,Screen flickering on upper side. Irritating.,1.0
Yash, 2 October 2019,This beast puts One Plus back in the game!7T should have been the only product launched by OnePlus instead of 7 & 7pro!What a phone it is!Processing speed 5/5Camera 4.2/5Look n Feel 4.8/5Performance 5/5Lags 0/5Charging 5/5Highlights:90GHz screen refresh rate is something that's puts OnePlus 7T in the league of the iPhones and the S10.Cons:Nightmode could have been better!Not upto the mark of Pixel and even iPhone 11Battery could have been 4000mah but still 30T warp is a mind-blowing deal.Memory slot could have been arranged.Wow factor:30T 😘Telephoto lens 😘Configs 8GB-128 combo is sufficientNow coming to comparison with iPhone XR and iPhone 11 personally I would prefer OnePlus because of flexibility Android ecosystem provides to the users.Verdict:A perfect benchmark from most of the parameters.Performance wise is a SHOWSTOPPER!!Should you upgrade from 7 to 7T -NO save your money.From iPhone 8 or Below to 7T -Yes,84,Winner of 2019!!!!,5.0

Alsaba Arshi, 3 October 2019,Firstly I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung Oppo Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.,66,Disappointing and not expected this from a flagship OnePlus phone,5.0
Akilandeswari, 4 October 2019,Very worst on speed. hanging and not responding at all. Got mobile day before yesterday on 2nd Oct and installed only basic apps like whatsapp fb banking apps and no movies or any other images or music loaded but still it is hanging.Now the clock is not working and the alarm is not ringing which is a very basic feature,66,very slow and hanging/don't trust this phone for alarm,1.0
Vineet D., 2 October 2019,It is good phone. Best at it's price point. Great phone better than Asus Rog phone 2 in overall performance. Buy it without any second thought. Better display 90hz fluid amoled 2400*1080. If you want a allrounder go for it.,65,Buy it without second thought,5.0
Srinivasa Reddy Madduri, 5 October 2019,I was using Samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try.  Received oneplus7t and set up the phone.  Not worth of spending. They don't have 3.5 mm audio jack and they don't provide type c connector also. Samsung phone comes with good quality headphones.  When apple released phone without audio Jack they provided connector.It's big disappointment for me as I make lot of calls using earphones.One plus need to think about it..,56,Not worth of spending so much money,1.0

Mayank Bhargava, 3 October 2019,"I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale  but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case it doesn't slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I've never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That's what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera as I'm not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won't be any heating issues.As for the battery back up on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half's backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it's an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours but I watched Netflix YouTube  used WhatsApp Twitter Instagram browsed the web made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes over a Day and a half's usage which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling texting browsing  social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It's an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn't face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn't encounter any issues to be calling customer care but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the ""Free 1-Year Extended Warranty"" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device is insured.All in all I would say it's a True Flagship device in the 30's price bracket.I just don't know what else a flagship phone can pack in more  perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren't a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can't use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don't find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it's ""Unofficially"" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don't try them :PWell just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE You won't regret buying it.",42,Indeed a TRUE FLAGSHIP!,5.0
Arjun Aradhya, 9 October 2019,I'm an iPhone user for last few years!! So I had a feeling any Android device cannot beat the camera display and user interface experience of iphone. But here it is OnePlus 7T with 90hz display is just a magic in hand. And also the camera is just superb.Initially I wanted to go for iPhone 11 buy instead decided to go for this and I feel I made a right decision. So close to eyes and go for this you'll love it,43,OnePlus 7T the best Android device experience ever!!!!,5.0

Sonali Rahinj, 2 October 2019,Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it's money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money.Interface- I used MIUI EMIUI amigo os but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It's super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram).Camera- One of the best under 50k that's the only thing I can say.Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphonesDisplay- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone)Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.,31,One of the Best Mobile Money can buy under 50k,5.0

Vishwendra Singh, 2 October 2019,Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.,22,The Fastest Just Got Faster,5.0

Raghav, 2 October 2019,Pros:Design looks sleek and easy to handle though it's a big screen. Well balanced in the hand. My 3T feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference.Good Speed and performance.Very good display.Excellent cameras. Definitely a big change from previous models.Cons:Still in the process of experiencing the product. Will update based on my findings.,19,Definitely a flagship product.....,5.0
Maureen andrews, 2 October 2019,Hands down. It's a beast. Flagship killer anyday.Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price.Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger.Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premiumStock android experience which I always love.Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent.I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn't look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don't need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing.Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go.Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.Hope this review is useful.,17,A major major major go.,5.0

Pranav Kumar Saxena, 2 October 2019,The said phone is a piece of beauty. Looks amazingly beautiful in hand and the in-hand feeling is just awesome.From the very beginning the buying process on Amazon is simply smooth thereafter the product was delivered before the expected delivery time.The phone looks really sophisticated and the 90 Hz Display is smooth like never before. The Glacier Blue colour is the one which is being promoted predominantly by OnePlus but trust me the Frosted Silver colour is stunning.These are just the initial impressions and a more detailed review will follow after a few days of intense usage.,15,A Superb Phone. Kudos! OnePlus,5.0
Mohammed Shahid Nawaz, 11 December 2019,Product is worse with respect to camera it cannot reproduce the skin tone or texture even under broad day light. It struggles to sharpness and structure of image.My earlier review was removed for being honest let's see the Amazon is really considering to hide the fact by not accepting the real customer problem and removing it,15,Camera is worse than a low budget Mobile camera,1.0
Amazon Customer, 6 October 2019,Battery life sucks!It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage.Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery.Think before you purchase.I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery. Otherwise everything else is fine with this phone. OnePlus needs to optimise the phone!,16,Battery life sucks!,3.0
Amy, 10 October 2019,Everything is fine .. but the slow-motion doesn't work properly it should start with normal speed then slow and then end with speed..but it's not at all good..it's awful..if you click 2 sec of video the phone will convert it to 30sec with very low speed and it's boring not similar as iPhone or any other phone..I just want to know it's with my phone or you guys are facing the same problem,16,Slomotion doesn't work properly,1.0

Sandeep Singh, 16 November 2019,Heating and battery drains very quickly. If battery life is not good then fast charging does not matters. No support from one plus customer care. Camera is fake. Portarit mode is very poor quality. I just want to tell the customers that oneplus is cheating its customers. Desperately wants to return this phone.,15,Poor battery life. Poor camera quality.

Priyank, 2 October 2019,Here are my initial impressions after using the phone for 3 days.Battery life is worse than my one plus 5 I usually watch YouTube for 1hr 4g and WiFi are always on. And listen to music on Bluetooth for 2hrs.After end of day I usually have 20% juice remaining.Multiple apps have issues with the supplied OS. Youbroadband app refuses to open Spotify has issues when listening to music on Bluetooth and camera app stutters at time.The new navigation system takes some getting used to and the case screen guard makes it very difficult to perform the back gesture.Now the positives.90hz refresh rate is noticeable.Speakers are loud and clear.Screen is beautiful.I watched couple of hdr videos and 1000nits screen makes the video pop out even more.Phone is blazing fast.And I love the clutter free oxygen OS.I haven't tested camera properly will update this review once I do.,11,Initial impressions after 3 days use,4.0

Sarathy, 9 October 2019,I got the phone on Monday from that day onward Mobile is showing downloading downloading... whereas it was not opening the Play store or i can't update any app onto the phone. Internet connectivity shows very slow. When i checked with my old phone it was downloading the app with in few second whereas this phone show downloading more than 1hr.  I am not happy the way mobile is functioning. I think there is an software issue into this phone.  Second when i use this phone my eyes are getting more strainGood things is the desing Batter Finger scanning. But software is creating the issue to use.,13,In my Phone Software update is not good,1.0
Parag Makwana, 4 November 2019,this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen.there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS.but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.,12,Read before buying this...

Yatin, 28 December 2019, Battery drains very fast.Camera result is so poor. Blurred photos are coming.Mainly phone hangs a lot with Normal operation. Refer attached video.Sometimes thumb lock is not working.When phone hangs it gets clear by switch on/off the phone.One day all of sudden phone screen turns into black color. By pressing all places on screen all side button press & switch on /off function was not helping to turn on the phone. So i put my charger to see if anything is happens to turn on the phone but not worked. Finally I pressed + key & lock key together & it turned on with fresh device.I need replacement with freah & healthy device or return back all my money. Amazon team plz guide how to make complain to One plus team.RegardsYatin,11,Phone is hanging a lot.,1.0
Ajmal Nizar, 4 December 2019, This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T  first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device  this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing  they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back  then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side  so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.,11,Worst Device that i have ever used in my life. Also the Worst after service brand.,1.0
Shubh Mishra, 9 October 2019,Ok so I am using this device from 3 days. Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons.1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well.2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review.3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it.4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus.Fingerprint facescanner and performance is perfect.,10,Too many issues.,3.0

Rajiv, 9 October 2019,Ladies and GentlemanPutting up this review after 1 week of rigorous use of the OnePlus 7T .Firstly if you have the money and you want to invest in a decent flagship phone and tired of the vivos and MIs of the world...then your search ends here!Presenting 1+7t the flagship premium phone presented to us by 1+Firstly to start off you are going to love the display...the 90Hz refresh is one beauty of a feature. Powered with sAMOLED display this phone doesn't leave any stones unturned.It has a nice powereful 8gb RAM that does justice to the phone. In short its an iOS version of AndroidWrap30t powerful charging powers your phone to 70% in less than 30 mins and 100% in less than  an hour. The charger is a bit bulky. But you are not going to carrry it all time with ur phone ;). the battery runs for about a day with mediun to high usage.Storage- if youare a heavy user with a lot of gaming and media content go for the 256gb version. Else 128gb should do the job well.Enhanced features like Digital wellbeing Zen mode helps u to measure ur screen time and achieve a good mobile-life balanceOxygenOS is smooth and this vomes with a perloaded  Oxygen10 OS out of the box.Dolby Atmos surround sound works like a masterpiece. You wont need the full volume most of the times..Pls note- this phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. You got to buy a good decent type C to Aux converter OR simply just buy a good Bluetooth headset.The camera is lovely. Pictures are just perfect with the right color balance. Doesn't whitewash ur pix like the mid range phones. It can put up a good show against the latest iPhone variants.The finger print sensor is decent and does its job.The packaging is premium. It is a big box All RED with an invite letter charger back cover some stickers.The phone comes with a preloaded glass protector and a premium case with all the cuts at the right places .Betwen 1+7 and 7t if you are running low on budget and willing to compromise on the Triple camera setup 30t charging 90Hz display...Go for the base 1+7 variant.Between 1+7t and pro go for 7t guys...as this is packed with a much advanced hardware.Guys also look for the 1+7t series launch on Oct 19 before evaluating.Hope you all enjoyed the review.

Manjunath mulimani, 4 December 2019,This phone is 2 months old i am still paying it's EMI and it just slipped and fell from sofa to floor with not much force. Phone display went green and it stopped functioning. Touch was also not working. Even though I had warranty for 1 year and there no physical damage on phone not even a single scratch. one plus told that it's physical damage and I have to pay 12000 to recover my phone their service is so bad that they don't listen to customer they will put all the blame on you even if the phone is defective. It's Normal for phone to slip and fall. I was using Moto g5s+ which was most durable phone. Also I had a colleague who had same issue with Samsung and they did everything with warranty so there is nothing as bad as one plus. This one plus is just making money it won't let you settle with what u have paid. If u buy one plus 7t u will never settle with one payment. Be careful one plus fans. I was one till this happened to me.,10,Phone display is of very cheap quality and not durable,1.0

Got heated up quickly on first round itself & fingers got sticky !Battery charges from 1% to 100% in 1 hour but drains relatively quickly.

Allen, 21 May 2020,I have always been a good fan of OnePlus phones. OnePlus 5 being my 1st purchase and after 2 years I thought of shifting to 7T  no nothing  happened to 5 its still running good.Ok everyone talks about speed RAM Performance... that's what OnePlus is about right? But how often have you heard good battery best camera being associated with OnePlus phones and this was no exception.- The most hyped feature 90Hz is though a very good feature but believe me you wont miss. Some features are like nice to have and not must to have. So 90Hz is a nice to have feature.- I used to fetch around 7 hours of SOT on my OnePlus 5 but it was a smaller screen. On 7T i never got SOT above 5 hours. The battery life is pathetic. 90Hz is responsible for it. Plus the battery optimization isn't great. Though fast charger makes for it but you just cannot rely on fast charger if ever you are caught in a situation of no power dont expect the 7T to be your saviour.- If OnePlus markets its displays so much then understand the fact that Samsung is king of it. U can usually find similar displays as in 1+7t in samsung M and A series also. No doubt OnePlus have their displays from Samsung.- Camera is another disappointment. I mean sometimes you can pull some great shots then the other time you just cannot believe the kind of bad shots that comes up. People if you are really buying this phone with camera being your priority then please get a mid-range smartphone and purchase a dslr.- Oxygen OS is great no doubt in that and i have no complaints with it. There is only one strange thing that happens is that chrome freezes at times.- OnePlus has never came up with a security solution like Knox by samsung. Data security is a growing concern and demand from the users everywhere but we dont see OnePlus coming up with anything like this. One thing that OnePlus should really focus is on R&D. OnePlus is making huge profit by just selling phones with 3rd party processor camera display by investing a little on their OS development.Do read about Samsung Knox and u will know why I am emphasizing on this.Talking about pricing OnePlus shall soon go out of hands from most important audience- college students working corporate people who definitely don't want a pricier phone so that it gives them a chance to upgrade after 2 yrs. It already disappointed many with 1+8 absurd pricing. OnePlus has to change their pricing startegy now. 30-40K is where they belong.Recommendation:If you want a worthy phone at 40k+ then better go for s10 lite. 1+8 isn't the phone to upgrade as there's hardly any specifications change and 1+7T shall still suffice your needs. Also 5G is very far from India getting fully operational for it.,5,Not what was expected,3.0

Binit, 2 October 2019,This is an awesome phone spec wise look wise and over all everything is spot on.I got the phone on 29th thanks to Amazon prime account. First impressions on look is amazing the new forsted sliver is first of its kind in smartphones.Pros:Android 10 out of the box all software updates was done. 90hz fluid display is amazing you can free the difference with smaller notch. Rear camera performance is good as you accept from OnePlus phones. Nightmode is very impressive I mean you can get pictures in very dark environment with very low light pretty decent. Performance no issues as it comes with 8GB RAM and best chip set in the market. 30WT waap charge is amazingly fast this will resolve the 3800 mAh battery issue literally it's crazy fast. Almost forgot the new micro camera feature is fantastic you can shot object from as low as 2.5 cm distance ( stability can be an issue ).Lastest oxygen os simple and fast as always. This makes the phone one of the best in this prize range. Almost missed the back cover is also of good quality 👍 for that.Cons:3.5mm jack missing- biggest for me as I have a great headphone for same.No usb-c to 3.5 jack donggle is provided.Selfie camera could have been better ( can improve with software updates )Camera bump for some ( okay for me ),7,Beast of its own - NEVER SETTLE,4.0

'Pickup your phone to show' and 'Tap the screen to show' stop working randomly. Sometimes 2-3 times in a day. Sometime it won't happen at all and sometimes it's so much frequent that I had to take a video of it and upload it on YouTube to showcase the problem to OnePlus. But as of yet no response from them.UPDATE -Thanks to Amazon my phone got replaced after the Amazon technician's visit concluded that the device was indeed buggy. The replacement arrived on 15th of October and till now no such bug has surfaced. Thanks Amazon !,5,Most affordable truly flagship phone,3.0
Umang Dave, 26 November 2019,Guys if you are buying this for camera then please don't buy. You will never be able to click pictures with natural colours. It always eover exposes images and changes the object colour. Also it applies beautification automatically. There is no option to disable beautification. Also there is no setting for depth control in portrait mode you cannot change the depth.The batteries drains out fast when you connect headfones through Bluetooth. Processing power is good but camera quality and battery life is a major drawback. Rather than this but Samsung Galaxy 10 series.,6,Not worth buying. Bad camera and battery life,1.0

Rajagopalan K., 7 October 2019,Editing after 3 weeks of usage of the replacement. Apart from the camera design the phone proves to be a wonderful package. Asusual a 5 star performer from Oneplus.Delivery took a week's time. After the long wait was eager to check the triple camera setup. When i took pics in wide the too right quarter of the image was too much hazy. First i thought it was some dust in front of the cam. After a close examination could find a dent or scratch over the wide angle lens. This was causing a hazy picture. When i tried to replace the phone with amazon they are not right away doing it and said there will be a technician at my door step in 3 days time to check on the issue. Based on his report the phone may be replaced. This is not fair already i waited a week to get the phone and again i won't be able to use it for another week 😣.I have been an oneplus admirer right from oneplus one and this have never happened with oneplus. My request to oneplus to tighten up the quality check before packing the priduct.A minute dent is making me wait almost 20 days to use your oneplus7t.Rest of the 2 cameras are super good. Macro is extraordinary and night scape has improved a lot.And focusing on my issue im uploading few pics. Check the top right corner for the haziness.Amazon please arrange the replacement as soon as possible. I may change my rating to 5 star once i get the good replacement.,5,Oneplus...Need to tighten up your quality check,5.0
Shruti, 4 October 2019,This phone is getting heated while charging and after using for 1 hour only without playing games  battery consumption is more. Camera quality is super specially night mode. Within 3 days it got hanged twice. I was using OnePlus 5 since 2 yrs it was a good phone with battery backup of one day without charging and with continuous use. It never gets heated even after using it continuously nor during charging too. I thought I should update my pH now to new one but the decision was not satisfactory for me.,6,Expectations were high not satisfied with the phone.,4.0

Abhyuday, 4 October 2019,"Unboxing experience is not good because of in-the-box accessories (there are none). Not asking for an earphone but at least a Type C to 3.5mm Jack was expected.Coming to phone. It is fabulous.Screen - Personally coming from QHD display to FHD Amoled display I can't see the difference. 90Hz refresh rate will make you feel other phones lagging.Build - Build quality is good. Gorilla Glass at screen is good enough to handle little drops. Back glass can be fragile. Use this phone with a case and take it out of it sometime to praise it's look.Performance - No words.Camera - A lot of playful modes that you can try shooting macro shots is great video stabilization is good 960 fps slow motion is also coming to this phone. Photos turns out great but Colors are not natural. Hope they can fix it with updates.Speakers - Loud and clear.Network Connectivity - Cellular reception is very good WiFi strength is also good. I am able to use WiFi where my previous phone struggled.Haptic feedback - OnePlus claims they have improved haptic feedback on this phone. They might have done it but there are better phones out there with better vibration. From my experience vibrations on this phone is thin but instant.Charging - Warp 30T is very fast. Charges to 100% in about an hour. Some people here are confused regarding the charging brick because they were expecting WARP 30T branding on the included charger. The internal circuitry inside this phone makes charging even faster the ""T"" is inside your phone not on the brick that's why included charger is WARP 30 and not WARP 30T.Oxygen OS - Smooth. No lag no heating quick updates inbuilt app lock and call recorder. The best android fork which is close to stock and have necessary functionalities built in.Verdict : If you are planning to buy a practical phone within 40k budget get this one you won't regret.",5,First OnePlus phone.

abhinav gupta, 14 October 2019,The best oneplus yet. Much improved as compared to its predecessor op7. Even if someone has op7 its well worth upgrading to the op7t.Pros:1. The latest hardware along with the latest software.2. Display. Absolute stunner of a display3. Camera quality. Probably not up to latest iPhone & pixel levels but it’s only a whisker away from them.4. Design & looks. Reduced notch increased screen size matt finished glass back choice of colours of the back.5. Sound quality from phone speakers.6. Oxygen os. Android 10 out of the box.Cons:1. No 3.5mm Headphone jack. No headphone included with the phone.2. Battery back not as good as op7 mostly due to bigger & faster refresh rate screen. However battery back is more than average. This con is basically nitpicking.The hardware & software this device offers for the price it is asking for is almost unbelievable. Price to perform ratio of this phone is probably the best in the market right now. For me it is. Disposed the op7 in favour of op7t coz it was well worth the upgrade.I would highly recommend this device.,3,Best price to perform ratio,5.0

Meet, 7 October 2019,Great phone but disappointing nonetheless. Given the price that we pay the satisfaction is not fulfilling.Pros:1. Great display 90hz display does wonders. (But you'll get bored of the smoothness within a day wanting for features more useful more evident more everyday).2. Fast charging is fast enough. Thank you for giving it in the box.3. Plus point for the design. Camera design is great compared to the square fiasco by other phones. Back is awesome both the Colors. Looks very premium. (But surely you'll keep a case hiding the greatness of the back).3. Oxygen OS is great compared to most other customised OS. Fast and smooth.4. Phone performs without any lag whatsoever with heaviest of usage. (Battery optimisation is not that smart apps reload quite a bit after minimising and reopening them. Real time messages are sometimes not shown till we open the app say WhatsApp.)5. Great box (no utility though only the feeling.)6. Cover supplied with the phone may not be beautiful but is strong enough and has proper cuts.7. Battery is good. (But with 90hz display and possibly heavy usage - obviously hence bought the phone with 855+ - the battery drains quite quickly. 3800 is less compared to the average in budget phones.) But anyway it covers the whole day and fast charging in the box is a good move.8. Love the side slider for sound.Cons:1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided. (Should've given that instead of the cover as cover is a personal choice but the converter is useful to all)2. SIM tray design is very bad. (My SIM tray got stuck on the very first day will have to go to the service centre god knows how much they'll charge.) SIM tray should have a lock system which holds the cards intact to avoid such problems. (Network is working fine just the tray won't come out so I can't change sim card now. Really disappointed with this issue on the very first day.)3. Camera performance battery performance and sound quality is good but expected more at this price point. (Though fast charger number of camera types and stereo speakers are the plus points.)4. Heavy and fat phone if you previously used slim and light phones.5. Android system utilizes almost 28GB of storage. (64 GB version is not present for a good reason.)6. Somehow not that satisfied or happy after getting the new phone. It's a great phone but still I feel a bit overcharged due to the cons faced.I believe all utilities should be provided out of the box for example 3.5 mm converter or c-type earphones or wireless earphones fast charger lens cleaner and glass cleaner etc. And all personalization accessories like covers screen guards lens guards stickers etc can be purchased by users themselves. This increases the overall utility of the box bundle.Here I'm purchasing an already expensive phone and then paying several more for some really necessary accessories.,3,Great phone but still disappointed.,3.0

Deepak Bansal, 20 May 2020,"I will tell you that things which no user & no Youtuber tells you.MY DEVICE IS NOT DEFECTIVE & NOT HAPPENED ANY ABNORMAL ACTIVITY.My review is based on usage of more than Six months.OVERALL LOOKS: Slim Premium Reduced Notch & less Bezzles 190gms weight but colour options are not good.HARDWARE: Someone may be impressed by its specifications BUT THE SCREEN USED BY ONEPLUS IS NOT QUALITY TESTED. Screen is having many issues not only with my device but with mostly all users. I have read comments of many users complaining about same in Official OnePlus Community app. They went to Service Centre & technician said it's Normal & this colour tinted problem will not increase. YOU MAY GOOGLE ""SCREEN ISSUES IN ONEPLUS 7T"".Screen is showing different colours in different parts of screen when Dark mode(Grey) & screen light 20% is applied. Grey theme is used in Gmail YouTube Chrome Whatsapp (instead of Black theme)SOFTWARE: I purchased Oneplus 7T considering it's Bloatware free Oxygen OS. But I dislike this OS among all other mobile OS. It is having bugs at lockscreen Dark mode Phone app & various other annoying issues.Dark mode in low light causes the icons & text hazy due to black area around icons & text. When you scroll page or any icon you can feel that black background is overlapping the texts & icons.CAMERA: Above Average No 4k recording & Blurred effect from front Camera 960fps Slow Motion still not available. Sharpness lacks  sometimes in images.BATTERY: Average. 3800mah. Due to 90hz refresh rate battery drains quite fast however 60hz option is available under settings.HEATING ISSUE: Many users in Community App are complaining about Heating issue in 7T while Charging & playing the phone. I m not a Gamer but yes it gets heatup quietly sometimes while charging.I purchased it for Rs. 37999/- but now regret. Even no one can identify the problem in 7T unless they use it because specifications & price are no doubt very goodI will NOT recommend ONEPLUS DEVICES to anyone. They don't have expert R&D TEAM for Hardware & software testing & optimization.",4,Not Recommended (Bugs & Screen Defects),2.0
RR, 24 October 2019,The phone freezes hangs multiple times. Speaker sound splits when you play games. I have been a OnePlus user but this 7T phone is really bad. Today is the 3rd day of my phone it is too big to handle heavy. Worst cases are: When you play games the speaker splits the music. The phone freezes. Hangs multiple times. When tried returning or replacement the Amazon technician says a branded phone worth 40000 cannot be bad. It is my worst nightmare after spending this much if no one is available to resolve your problem or atleast look at it!,4,DON'T BUY! Faulty Piece Delivered!,1.0
sumit nayak, 15 October 2019,Writting this review after 3 week of use. The pros are camera 90hz display and wrap 30t charge. And the cons are heating issue. If you are going to use it for gaming purpose then this device will heat up in just 20-30 mins. Didn't expect it from OnePlus. The battery backup is not that good. But the wrap 30T charger makes up for it. Overall it's a good phone but not for gaming.,6,Its a okey product not a wow.,3.0

Naushad Ansari, 11 October 2019,"What a beauty and beast.It doesn't run it fly.Its my third one plus device.One plus3 6 and now 7T.Amazing display 90hz is amazing. Every animation feels smooth and fast. I compared it with iphone 11 of my colleague guess what? I felt lags in the iphone11 animation. It was nowhere near to one plus 7T display smoothness. Its hard to revert to 60hz display.For people boasting iphone 11 camera performance i would say its marginal not as hyped.If iphone 11 scores 100 then i would give 97 to one plus 7T in photography.Iphone 11 is definitely better in videography.But genuinely one plus 7T camera is better than other and compete with flagship.I would say "" 19-20 ka farq hai"".Come to speakers.Loud and clear you will enjoy every sound from the device. One of the best speaker in flagship.Vibration is significantly improved from last one plus generation and its one of the best among flagship.Screen fingerprint print is stupidly fast and face unlock is insane.Only consCoz its 90hz display its obvious it would consume more power.Battery backup is average but warp charge come to the rescue. Fastest and coolest charging",4,BAAP OF IPHONE AND SLOWPHONE,5.0
Jayanta Dutta Banik, 16 October 2019,The unit which i received made me to rethink about my purchase and Oneplus quality. Reason are:-- Never in last couple of years have i faced any heating issue with Oneplus 566t until i purchased 7t- 90hz screen refresh rate really ?? When you pack high end features relatively low priced phone (although with SD 855+) it results in screen flickering hanging problem and heating at the back- Despite having same can setup as 7pro ( my best frnd's)  it is quite noticeable that the pics aren't that sharp and detailed once zoomed in and seen later- Quick charge yes but quick draining of battery charge? Not a Oneplus thing despite of 3800 mah batteryI wish i could have been able to return phone but Amazon policies suck.,5,"Really Disappointed with 7t ""Never Settle"" to ""Never Ever""",1.0

Jacob Dhanraj, 2 October 2019,Crazy Fast!!! The SD855+ is a powerhouse and runns anything you throw at it super smooth. The display is BEAUTIFUL and extremely fluid thanks to 90Hz refresh rate. OnePlus says 30% of harmful blue light is cut off and you can really see that. The display also gets plenty bright tooThe cemras do need some more work which and sure will be fixed over software updates in the days to come. I do Miss the headphone jack but we also miss days where global warming was not a thing!!Battery is not as good as the other OnePlus phones all cause the display is a power hungry Led thanks to the 90hz refresh rate. Drop it to 60hz and voila your good to go!! But then if you would do that there is no sense in buying this phone in the first place. And also you have Dash Charge 30T. Which charges your phone lighting fast....The case provided in the box is off good quality and can be used fulltime as a case.Will update this is a few days. Delivery was a little slow but can't help it.,3,Stupid Fluid Fast!!,5.0
I SAI SREE HARSHA, 2 October 2019,Let me start with tag BOOM💥It has every thing you wantPros1.snapdragon 855+ extremely smooth and eccentric performance2.android 10 out of box is quite fantastic3.ram management is effective and most of the time u have 70% of the ram available as free even after gaming .4.the display is epic and I personally prefer flat screen so it is nice smooth and fabulous the 90hz display is extremely satisfying and even it has an option to reduce to 60hz which is quite handy.5. Camera is absolutely amazing crisp quality top notch performance low light to outdoor perfect scenarios the camera performes as expected and crazy as hell.even the 4k video with 60fps is stunning . Front can is quite good with nice color contrast and white balance gets u wonderful indor and outdoor selfies .6.gaming beast .pubg cod  fortnite runs extremely smooth with 90hz display the games are amazing.7.battery is good as it lasted me a day with 20% remaining that to playing games for 10 to 20 min with gps and mobile data on for the most of the time .avg on screen time 6hr 20 min to 7hr (if not playing games and gps turned off ...u get better time).8.WARP charge is beast .In 20min the phone charged from 8% to 84% which is silly fast and crazy as hell . Charge for 20min and enjoy full day battery .9. one more thing it even now support hdr streaming in Netflix and prime which is quite good and satisfying ( I didn't check with previous ones if they have ignore this point).10.oxygen OS is upgraded and customization is very nice and for dark and theme lovers it will be extremely satisfying and convinient to use .11.build quality is amazing the panel is smooth and matte like feel is nice .it comes with preapplied protector on screen and it's good .we get PVC back case which is nice and firmly holds the phoneCons:1.the mighty headphone jack is gone and it's quite a bummer . One plus doesn't provide the extended type c to 3 .5 mm jack which is disappointing but in the world of Bluetooth this can be adjusted.2.NO LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT this is personal choice and I prefer to have notification light which indicates any notifications and charge indication..3.no memory slot which is kind of ok with me but still who doesn't want extra storage 😉Verdict: premium phone with flagship features and BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK . If u are premium lover just go for it .go.goo..gooooo.,5,One hell of a phone 😍⚡⚡,5.0
Ram, 6 October 2019,Been a loyal OnePlus user for a long time. Got a great deal and so ordered by trading my OnePlus 3T. Received the phone today and had random restarts screen freezes and blackouts. Even while setting it up the first time had a screen blackout later after using it for a few mins it started to reboot randomly for no real reason. The phone didn't have any damage but I believe am the one who got a rare faulty item. Reached out to amazon over phone had to wait in queue for like 20 mins then customer care rep understood the issue and scheduled a Service Visit to check the issue post which if he determines its a faulty unit I might get a replacement new phone. Will update review and rating post that.Update 10-10-2019:After a lot of struggle and blockages finally got it replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Nitu from Amazon who helped me out. The replaced device was new one and works as it should so fluid and stable. Lovely device. Also installed OnePlus care app and claimed the complimentary extra 1 year warranty if you guys haven't done it you should.,3,Received the odd faulty product but got a new replacement unit,5.0
M.Maren kumar, 7 June 2020,Im a COMMON MAN who is living in KancheepuramTamil Nadu  India . I was using oneplus phones for last 6 years ( Op 35t6 ) . Recently I bought ONEPLUS 7T from AMAZON for 34k on JUNE 3 . I was using stable version oneplus on June 3 and 4 . In stable version the phone was heating while gaming and also playing videos . I checked the temperature with the app cpu temperature shows more than 50°c and 43°c with battery temperature . I updated to stable to open beta and checked and the phone is heating the same . Thus I decided to go for replacement with Amazon .I called Amazon for replacement of the device upto 6 to 8 times and 2 times I got hang up obvisiusly. The replies and the solutions they recommended I will mention below ( by Amazon tech agents )1. They told me to download an app called BLANCCO DIAGONOSTIC ( this app got 1.8 stars in playstore ) because they recommended this app for testing the device remotely and it came normal as 37°c as im not doing other than voice calling in phone and they tell me that if the TEMPERATURE CROSSES 47°C only and I can replace the phone . ( Common man voice : How a phone will get 47°c ? Is 43°c for the new phone is not enough for a replacement )2. One of the agent telling me that I should play the game and watch videos and call them at the same time to the Amazon customer service and go to that app and test and show the temperature ( Common man voice : how can I keep the temperature same then they are making me to wait for a call 3 to 5 minutes everytime )3. In covid-19 situation  told to visit the service centre at vellore ( 75 km away from my place ) and make them to test the device and get the job card that the device is faulty and then they are ready for replacement . ( Common man voice : How can i go without epass and I want to spend day in this situation for the fate that I bought the Oneplus brand phone I trusted 6 years )4. At last I tried talking to a Amazon techician Mukesh and his higher authority named Nisha on JUNE 7 for more than a hour requesting for device by showing them in Amazon support email complaint and attachment ( I sent before a day and I got no reply other than computer reply )  and they replyed the same that I should go service centre or I just register pick up & drop .Inbetween they told me many troubleshooting methods and make me format my phone two times within two days .At last I thought someone will help from Oneplus service . Here it goes their replies for 5 calls :1 . Go to service centre or Pick up drop service  and give the new device to them and inspect and then when they think there is fault they will think about it for replacement or repairing it or changing the software . ( Common man voice : New device heating with 43°c with screen shot and photo is not enough as evidence for them to replace )2. Why Amazon is giving 10 days replacement policy for oneplus devices when they don't want to replace when there is heating complaint from a customer and oneplus agent told me to ask to Amazon tech support ( Common man voice : Oneplus instructing not to replace product and how the Amazon take all the blames )There is conclusion here that AMAZON TECH & ONEPLUS are partners in every way when they want to neglect the customer when it's comes to complaint and services .Thank you Oneplus and Amazon for a nice after service and I'm going with consumers complaint with all the evidence I got if I don't get the replacement when the screen shot is not enough for my replacement .Please Be aware Oneplus fans ...,3,Oneplus 7t heating with battery temp 43°c and No replacement from amazon,1.0
Sriiiii, 31 October 2019,I really disappointed with this phone. I have brought it 3 weeks back.At my office I just kept in my jeans pocket and laid or  very gently touched to my laptop table and then the back panel was broken. Such a sensitive body is had ....  I request you not to buy onepluse especially onepluse 7t. Its a waste of money...Hence it again proved CHINA mobile are always CHINA only....ii really disappointed with this. So i was supposed to say this. I hopefully it will helpfull for others better go with someother mobile in market. In my case even warranty is also may not work.I'm getting doubt whether Amazon is selling genuine products or not....or fake products,5,Waste of money...CHINA mobile are always CHINA,1.0
Kiran, 10 November 2019,◾Design✔️Excellent premium 'dreamy' new design with high quality materials and top-notch build quality - the frosted glass at the back just adds a new dimension to not just the visual appeal but also the in-hand feel.✔️The front has a smaller teardrop notch than the OnePlus 7✔️A bit smaller than the OnePlus 7 Pro and slightly easier to hold (it's still on the large side though on absolute scale so if you don't like big phones you might want to reconsider)✔️Basic water resistance (though it's not IP rated)✔️Snappy in-display fingerprint scanner✖️The camera bump at the back may be an eyesore for some (it's subjective though)◾Display✔️Gorgeous super smooth 90Hz AMOLED display - along with the display on the OnePlus 7 Pro this is one of the most amazing displays out there on any smartphone - you will enjoy how much zippier and smoother the phone feels scrolling through things like web pages and apps✔️Strong brightness and great sunlight legibility✔️This time it's also a flat screen without the curved edges of the OnePlus 7 Pro - while that makes it look perhaps less stunning it's a more practical design from a usability point of view◾Software✔️OnePlus continues to have one of the most refined butter-smooth minimalistic (nearly stock) yet very useful Android skins with some handy off-screen gestures smart customization options an excellent and improved 'Reading' mode and Zen Mode to control your phone usage - the excellent software experience remains one of the primary reasons to consider a OnePlus phone◾Performance✔️Breakneck speeds with the new Snapdragon 855 Plus (which is supposed to be about 15% faster than 855 with graphics) and fast UFS 3.0 storage✔️Playing graphic-intensive games is smooth and the phone is lightning quick at launching and quitting apps surfing the web and taking photos◾Camera✔️Good versatile triple rear camera setup almost identical to the OnePlus 7 Pro - the only significant difference is that the telephoto lens while packing more pixels (12MP vs 8MP on the 7 Pro) lacks OIS and has up only to 2x zoom (instead of 3x on the 7 Pro)✔️What that means is that picture & video quality is also very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro - in daylight the photos are clear bright and vibrant with some very good HDR rendering - in low light too the performance is more than decent and the Night mode helps with that✔️The wide-angle camera takes bright and sharp landscape photos and the pictures don't show much warping around the corners as wide-angle cameras tend to do✔️The new macro mode is good too - allowing you to take pictures of objects closer and with much more in focus than before✔️Portrait shots are also great - the fallout between the foreground and background looks smooth and natural and you can now take portrait photos with the wide-angle camera as well✔️The 16MP front camera is good too - again similar to the 16MP front camera on the OnePlus 7 Pro✖️It's a very competent camera setup for the price but again it's not quite up to the level of the most expensive flagships like the Galaxy S10 series Galaxy Note 10 series Pixel 3 series or the iPhone 11 series◾Audio✔️Uses its earpiece as a speaker which gives the OP7T an excellent stereo audio setup - it's even slightly louder than the 7 Pro - and one of the best stereo audio setups on a current smartphone✖️No included earbuds or a 3.5mm headphone adapter◾Battery✔️Good battery life with a 3800mAh battery and a 1080p screen - you will comfortably get a day's use even with the 90Hz display✔️Amazingly fast charging with the new Warp Charge 30T technology - it charges to 34% in 15 min and 68% in 30 min◾Verdict✔️On the whole the OnePlus 7T is an excellent top-grade addition to OnePlus' tradition of providing top-grade flagship devices at surprisingly reasonable prices - arguably its best value device in recent times - it's again the new 'budget flagship' to beat - near perfect✔️Between this and the OnePlus 7 Pro it will be mostly down to whether you value the curved screen and the pop-up selfie camera enough to pay the extra moolah - for most people the OnePlus 7T will be the more sensible value choice✖️If you want to look at even lesser expensive budget flagships though you do have some strong options now - the two best value ones would be the Asus 6Z and the Redmi K20 Pro - though you will be missing out on the super smooth 90Hz display and the great software experience of OxygenOS,2,2 minute review,5.0
B.k.Thilaga, 3 October 2019,The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.Well now the cons:1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.2)  The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus.,4,Not Just an incremental update.,5.0

Rupesh L., 9 October 2019,Regarding the one plus seven T I received on the 6th OctoberI d like to tel you that I was disappointed to see that on opening the wrap of the phone there was a lot of finger mark n prints on both the front and back of the phone. And I had to clean it well before placing the cover . The packing inside looked crumbled /bend and the phone plastic wrap had a dog ear on one end . Air bubble in one corner of the screen guard which I removed . I am not complaining but this is Not WHAT U EXPECT from a premium brand like yrs and i had just moved from the 7 to this with expectations . All fresh pack is opened expecting it to looks freshhhhh :) its a feel i think I was robbed offJust thought of informing you thisIt’s a pity the one plus don’t have a tamper proof seal on the box like the other phonesI even felt if it were some display piece send 🙂In the pic I have sendU can see the bend on the board inside and the dog ear on the plastic protective coverUnfortunately I cleaned the phone before I thought of clicking the finger marks battery life could be better Fingerprint reader is good camera quality is goodBest regardsDr Rupesh PL9995323630,4,Good camera bad delivery,3.0

Pradeep, 5 October 2019,Everything I found value for money. 7T is best among 7 7PRO and 7T. I can see some rainbow effect on screen when seen from angle. Also camera color scheme change when you switch between lens.Though using Amazon from long time disappointed by their corrupt practice this time with this phone.

Rhushikesh K Joshi, 2 October 2019,First impression was good. Super fast response for face detect and finger scan. But Whatsapp hangs during video call. And screen though FHD AMOLED it's nowhere near Samsung phone displays. 1080p videos look like 360p videos on YouTube.,6,Good product,3.0

Rahul Kumar, 26 October 2019,"Dissapointing phone!!Graduated from onleplus7 to 7T in just 2months but its been 3 weeks and the expirience with 7T has been really very poor and frustrating.Major Issue- the phone has a major display issue which comes into notice in the 2nd week.1. ""Tap to Wake"" function doesn't work most of the times. You will have to press the power button to wake up the phone.2. The ""Ambient Display"" function wherein the phone wakes up upon picking it up also doesn't work 80% of the time.REALLY FRUSTRATINGNo worth 40k price tag just for a Big screen and 3cameras.I doubt if d screen wud work for 1year also.Oneplus should come with solution if they actually care for Indian customers.Waste of Money",4,Major Display Problem with Oneplus 7T - Display doesnt work most of the times,1.0

mithun, 26 November 2019,I had been a frequent user of one plus right from OnePlus 1 5 and 6t. I had recently  bought one plus 7t all other features - performance camera interface are good but the battery backup is not even average it's pathetic. I had already replaced the device once within couple of days of purchase as amazon technician also confirmed there is some serious battery drain issues. Yesterday I received a new device and it seems the battery life is even worse than the previous one. I feel amazon has just replaced the device with some other battery issue model and have not ensured the new model is as per the specification mentioned by the manufacturer (amazon representative had assured that the new piece will be in good condition - bit this was not ensured by them) . You cant expect someone to pay 38k and have a screen on time of 2.3 hrs. Let me know how would you resolve this as I am tired to Lodge a complain again and again.,4,Serious battery drain issues in the device,2.0

vivek, 4 October 2019,"Pros:- Display is fabulous!- Speakers are extremely loud and audio quality is amazing!- Cameras take great pictures! Much better than I expected at this price point.- Performance: SD855+ and 8 GB RAM. Obviously it has blazing fast performance!- Warp Charge 30TCons:- Battery life could've been better but Warp Charge 30T makes up for it for me at least.- No headphone jack. Welcome to 2019! :(Note: I was going through some of the other reviews written by people. Some people are giving less stars because they didn't receive the ""big box"" which they saw on YouTube which is stupid because that was a review unit packaging sent to reviewers by OnePlus 8-10 days prior to the launch. Obviously we don't get all of those things. Also someone wrote that we get a Warp Charge 30 charger not 30T inside the box. I'd like to clarify that both charge at 30W the difference is just in the way they charge. We're getting 30T charger in the box don't worry.",2,Expected nothing less from OnePlus! 💙,5.0

SUMIT BARNWAL, 15 June 2020,Biggest question is why to spend 35k and buy a phone which screen is not even gorrilla glass 3. Breaks off after falling from bed to floor. What's the point?Okay so I brought my phone on 29-Dec and it was working okay so far. All of a sudden yesterday it fell of the bed and screen which is claimed to be gorilla glass 5 had 2-3 linings despite the fact that it had front n back cover.

Arjun, 30 November 2019,I'm not a gamer. Mostly I used my phone for taking photos calling browsing and handling office works. I liked Oxygen OS. it awesome (like Android one + additional features). And high-end performance (High-end processor + 8 GB). 90 Hz display is good. So I gave rating 3 stars in one month of experience.Negative1. Camera # 2-star rating.Landscape + sunlight (12+48) -  Giving very very poor low-level performance I expected. Producing high boosted images (a Mixed form of colour+ contrast + sharpen) and autofocus also not giving better performance. (I uploaded a sample image taken from back camera without any edit). Night group photos are good (Mostly ppl won't take photos on the night it's the rare case).  2. Heavy weighted body size and round camera body - It not comfort for men's pants pockets. Default to care for the camera.3. USB C type to Jack 3.5 audio - Very small size and expensive item. (It's free with Oneplus 6T) 4. Then they are changing prices day by day. I expected Oneplus to have brand value. It's will reduce the goodwill of the company soon. I think all Chinese devices have the same quality. Conclusion - Better to take Google Pixel. Mi phones are also good for photography. But hardware quality is not. I won't promote OnePlus 7t. Please don't trust youtube comparison video makers. They are promoters.,4,High performance and low level camera,3.0
DILIP MUDIREDDY, 19 October 2019,Phone Onplus7T is good overall but not so great.Not so great phone from Oneplus when compared to it's previous phones. Disappointing display and quality 90Hz refresh rate is of no use Oneplus 6 display is far superior. Though the specs of 7T says fluid AMOLED it doesn't feel so.Only positive compared to Oneplus6 way older version of it is it's camera. Camera quality has been improved.Front camera has not been changed at all it is still same old one with same old quality.Camera has still same old issues of getting hanged and making phone unresponsive unless you reboot it. If you forget to reboot it will make all other apps hang including your default message app.Wrap Charge is ok but bot up to the expectation.Speaker Quality is awesome.Videos at 4K gives over saturated colours  and doesn't look good at all.Horrible part of this phone is it's navigational gestures older version navigation gestures used to be so cool.Somehow in my phone autorotate is not working properly may be the issue with my phone sensor.,2,Not a great phone disappointing display quality 90Hz refresh rate is of no use,3.0

Recently got 10.0.4 and the camera quality has improved.Whatsapp for 7T has bugs - while in PIP mode navigating into other chats or media within the app doesn't work.

Rajesh Katoch, 5 October 2019,This is my second one plus device after one plus 6.I was planning to buy one plus 8 when it comes but found a good deal on this.  Now coming to phone it is awesome device but software bugs are there which I hope will clear over a couple of updates.1. Camera is fantastic. Addition of ultra wide and telephoto is good. But 2* zoom and super macro are just Ok nothing very special. This time camera placement is different aka Motorola. May be you like it or hate it. Nightscape has been improved pictures attached.2. Fantastic display with 90hz refresh rate but no option to hide notch.3. Battery backup is ok warp charging is awesome.4. Fingerprint scanner is ok. Though Not so fast and convenient as rear mounted scanner.5. A good quality pre applied screen guard and in box cover (looks better than cover supplied with one plus 6) are good. Though aftermarket covers are not available right now.6. Processor  Ram and storage there is nothing to talk about they are best in class.Edit1: with software update there is hide notch option but implementation is bad. Adjacent area of notch is not used all like previous options. Better use notch or third party app.,2,Awesome phonesoftware neeeds improvement,4.0
Bashar, 8 October 2019,Well I am using OnePlus since OnePlus 5 launch.Not an adequate phone. Battery life is not good like other OnePlus phones. Even OnePlus 5t is giving better battery life.

Like tap to show fingerprint in ambient display not working notifications are not showing in ambient display even it is turned on.,4,Not upto the mark.,2.0
anuquiet, 3 November 2019,Please don't buy this mobile. It's just a month and camera has conked off. Since it wasn't within replacement period I need to go to external vendor for replacement/service. I had OnePlus 5T and got this in exchange thinking to upgrade. But never thought I would be cheated with this pathetic quality. How can such costly and OnePlus phone can blank out with camera and other in built apps. As mentioned in OnePlus community I checked for alternatives was told to erase and go back to factory reset mode. Did it twice but no use with blacked out apps. I seriously doubt the quality of OnePlus now. Lost faith in this brand.,4,Quality compromised,1.0
Sudhakar, 7 October 2019,So After research on youtube for last couple of months to upgrade my OP3T ended up buying oneplus 7T . Its been 48 hours with the phone and i feel the phone is not VFM. The reason lies with the other excellent phones under 25K which can provide 90% of this performance. Beyond 25K law of diminishing returns kicks in. If you still decide to spend 40K for an android phone and ok with mediocre camera you can buy this eyes closed. The details of my observations are as below.Ergonomics and Build qualityThe phone is Huge.This is not deal breaker as we get used to this eventually. The build quality is good though we can see most of the phones beyond 15K started having decent build quality.So no points to OP since we are paying premium for this.The camera setup may not look great but who cares since it is on the back of the phone. The pre applied screen protector doesn't server any purpose except that we don't need to buy the screen protector/tempered glass immediately. It buys you some days. It doesn't matter if its blue or silver as we all cover them up in cases or skins.DISPLAYThe Screen quality is good(Read Not Excellent) and AMOLED colours are accurate except for the Whites. The whites are not accurate like in any other AMOLED panel. Dark mode is the savior though.Wonder why phones these days are trying to look like shilpa shettytall and slim. I am 16:9 guy so didn't like this 20:9 aspect ratio.The 90HZ panel is excellent however there are very less games which could use this. For ex the famous PUBG can give 60FPS at max. The phone creates the perspective of super snappiness because of this 90HZ. Combining this panel with SD855+ makes this phone an excellent performer. The phone does support HDR on netflix however i did not find any breathtaking difference with that in the video qualityCAMERA There is nothing great to talk about this camera quality Average at best.THe photos doesn look detailed Sharp. We cant choose the resolution and cant take 48MP photo. I know MP is not everything but this helps to crop and take good prints. The wide angle and telephoto lens addition is a good thingattracts the people who beleive in Specs but not in actual performance. The photos from these phone are a slight improvement from my OP3T which is not so positive thing considering 24K K20 pro provides similar or slightly better photos. Google Cam is not that stable so we have to wait for updates from oneplus.The MACRO mode is also a good addition which we might use it in initial days and  eventually forgot that this even existsSoftwareThis is where Oneplus excels and will make any other android phone bites the dust.The UI is intuitive and no qualms about it.Onplus is good at providing updates on time and should be fine with the support for next three years.AudioThe audio from loudspeaker is good and as everyone know there is know headphone Jack. I feel how important this Headphone jack isespecially when i started using this phone. I am yet to use the phone with BT headphones. Would update the review when i use it with my M50s.Overall SuggestionIf you decided to buy a phone list down top 5 features you need/want in a phone. If camera is listed in top 2 Do not buy this phone. Period.,3,Don't Not Buy The OP7T( Yeah inspired from unbox therapy),3.0
Anket Ghosh, 1 November 2019,I have bought  Oneplus 7T one month back. Exactly after one Month  Phone is facing one new issue of automatically switching off and on for continuous 4 and half hours. And continuously during the time of the reported new issue Mobile temperature is gradually increasing and it's getting overheated.Last One month experience was really very good but the reported issue is great disappointment towards Oneplus team. I don't know why they are not optimizing the performance Camera as well as UI along with bug to further improve the user experience.

Md Marghoob Inam Naghmi, 27 October 2019,I am using this phone from last one week. My experience is Fantastic.1. Looks is great. It looks Amazing in hand.2. Colour is good. A little bit downside from the 7.3. Screen - Best in category. At 90HZ it just feel amazing to touch it and scroll trough it. Its smooth and vibrant. You have to use it to feel it.4. Camera - great. Improved from the older one due to improve hardware. Still some improvement required and I thick Oneplus will do it through patch. I have tool some pictures in different condition and Image production is Great. I really loved the macro mode. Still not the top notch but one of the best produced by Oneplus.5. Speaker - Dolby sound. Sound through speaker is good even at high end.6. Battery - Good back up but it may be improved in future models. When you have phone with 90HZ then it will drain the battery fact hence more battery power is required. Once plus should have used 4100mAH battery. But still one charges is enough for one day. And you also have Warp Charger and it is faster than the Dash. So not to worry about it.7. Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+. It works very smooth. Multitasking is easy with it. With new GPU it work well for all Games. You can play any Game without any lag.So overall the best phone of 2019...You should buy it without any hesitation...You will not be disappointed.,One,What a Phone.,5.0

Syam, 11 June 2020, Worst phone I have received. I was not able complete installation process. It was taken 10 hours time but not completed installation process. If you can see video clip you can understand my issue. It was running like 10 hours. When I started my office hours I have tried to opened and kept on my desk beside to me. By the time of log off my office system my phone is in same condition literally.When i explained the issue with amazon technical team they have investigated my images which i have sent in email and agreed for replacement.Next day replacement came here another worst experience. Delivery agent wanted to open and check IMEI number in mobile itself. When mobile is opened why could i raised for replacement. But delivery agent still wanted to open and see IMEI number in mobile si he has tried but not opened. So he refused to replace the product and left away without replace mobile.I ever never experienced this bad situation with anything,One,Defect product Received,1.0

Giri K., 5 January 2020,This review is after 2 weeks of phone use.I would rate an overall 4.3/5 for this phone.* An awesome amoled experience with 90Hz display the only con being the battery that doesn't last long.* As i was using Moto before i don't find the smiley kind of camera annoying. The triple camera is just perfect to capture moments. Few cons would be some enhancement of zoom in night mode and a better potrait mode camera.* The processor is too good apps run very smooth and switch between apps is also smooth.* Battery I'd good normal/average usage would last 12-18 hours. Videos and gaming woudl eventually reduce this duration.* Warp charge is good personal experience of 53min charge from 12% to 100% - charger could be used while gaming.* With a budget of 40k rupees i would recommend this phone.,One,A smooth experience.,4.0

Hiren Garai, 1 June 2020,I bought the device few days back and what I feel is it's absolutely worth the money. The build quality the heptic the software are all it's best part. The stock camera is not that good but as you know good photos can be the outcome of some trash camera also if you are good enough to take decent pictures. ( You can seamlessly install gcam and use it)The battery life is where I think OnePlus little bit stumbled upon. In daily usage ( no heavy gaming ) I get around 6 hours of sot which is pretty good actually with this 3800 mah battery. But sometimes it feels that the battery is draining too fast but again that can be fixed via software updates. The 30 watt fast charging is just a relaxation ! You don't have to worry about your battery getting charged in time if you forgot to switch on inspite of plugging in ! No heating during charging ( The power break becomes hot although). ( Don't use your smartphone for heavy tasking during charging then it might get hot )The fingerprint scanner is also good not the best but good. Sometimes it denies to accept my thumb ! The phone never overheats imo. ( Although if you keep your brightness max with 90hz in bright sun and play with camera or do some heavy task then it might get hot enough to worry )The software is one of the main plus point of OnePlus. It comes with android 10 out of the box so it will definitely get 2 major android upgrades and 3 years of bimonthly security patch updates.Overall coming from my 3 and half years old redmi note 4 to this OnePlus is making me enjoy my phone once again. The device is definitely worth for you if you want flagship grade performance with least amount spending.,2,Till a good value for money in the time of OnePlus 8 series,5.0

But the display and smoothness that One Plus offers is unparalleled.Pros1 Superior display 90hz2 super fast fingerprint reader3 fnatic gaming mode4 excellent battery life (90hz gives 4-5 hours and 60 hz gives an hour more )5 camera improved to the best.

This phone camera doesn't have 16:9 mode so watching them on TV shows unused black screen (this is a major use case for most of us).I am using Nikon D5300 DSLR for almost 5 years but occasionally want to use a good camera phone for family pictures. So in that hope i purchased this phone.  But when we compared some photos taken from iPhone 7 & this phone on Sony Bravia android 4k TV iphone 7 photos/videos seemed much more natural and pleasant than this phone. I tried to use Google Camera as well as oneplus Pro mode but still unable to beat iphone 7 in terms of photo quality. Obviously iphone 7 doesn't have telephoto & wide angle cameras and have lower pixel rating. So I believe iphone XR must have much better quality.Other features of mid range phone is also comparable at much cheaper price (Samsung m30s Redmi Note 8 Pro Realme XT have very similar features) so whats the point of this hyped oneplus brand.Also I am not gamer so a phone within 6"" display is much more pleasant but still went ahead with this heavy & large size phone (6.5"" forget to operate it from single hand & more seems like carrying a tablet all the time) just for a good camera sake which is also not up to the mark.Now I have stuck with this phone as Amazon & oneplus has only replacement policy in India but these same companies have 15 days refund policy in US & UK (so much bias towards India where they sell most of these units). There has been only 3 days since I received this phone. If anybody interested in purchasing it I can give it away at reasonable discount.",3,Poor Quality Chinese phone with lots of gimmick & hype,1.0
Shashikant, 15 October 2019,I have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used period. Right from the unboxing the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch moviesvideos play games. The colors are vivid bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!) activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T,2,Best Android premium phone so far !!!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 15 May 2020,This is the third time I am editing and reposting the review.The phone is a real beauty. It feels looks and is a premium device. Performance is awesome. 90 HZ display will make you never wanna go back to 60. Games play nice. Display quality is not high as expected but is never a dealbreaker. Camera is good under proper illumination. Macro feature is outstanding and video recording is also great.Now for the cons: YouTube fit to screen option doesn't work most of the time. Screen freezes while on Youtube and also Amazon prime.Battery drains quickly if you are playing games or even on Youtube. Normal use can give up to 8- 9 hours of battery life but on 90 HZ mode or gaming or streaming expect only upto 6 hrsHeating is also an issue while on games.,2,Good performance....but....,4.0
Ausan singh, 4 October 2019,Oneplus making fake hype.Camera takes blurry and noisy pictures.Capturing picture is slower then my 4 year old ipho e 6s.

Devu, 25 October 2019,I initiated a return for this product as there are some camera glitches. When replacement and return was initiated there was IMEI mismatch due to which my product was taken and was put on hold with no status change. And today when they returned the product back to me saying there is imei mismatch they cannot accept it  I found out that the imei they were carrying was of another product samsung m30s which i bought together with my oneplus 7t. Such a great negligence by amazon and a havoc they have created by their pathetic service. Worse than ever. They are troubling the customers for no reasons and i think have trained all their customer executives to just assure the customer with their words & fill their survey will shinning colours and no action takes place.,3,IMEI NO. mismatch due to amazon negligence,1.0
Amazon Customer, 6 October 2019,Being a first time OnePlus user I am actually flattered! Camera quality was great and the new macro mode was exceptional. Personally preferred the photos from GCam though. 90Hz refresh rate is the best feature and you can blindly give your money just for that. A bit unsatisfied with the battery life but cant complain as the warp charger 30T charges the phone upto 75percent in just 30 minites.Oxygen OS is my new favorite. Highly recommend!,4,The money is for the Display smoothness!,4.0
Sanath Kumar, 5 October 2019,pros:Beautiful display smooth like never beforeExcellent software experienceGood audio output from the dual speakerSharp selfies from the front cameraWarp charge is super fastcons:over saturated photos from the back camers(might be solved in the future software updates)Photos take during night come out dark and has too much of noise.Average battery lifeAll the cons mentioned above could be resolved over the future software updates so those might not be considered as deal breakers,3,Overall a good buy,4.0
Nanda gopal, 15 October 2019,I like the Speed and built-in quality of the phoneCamera is amazingOne of the fastest smartphoneBut battery life sucks I have to charge 3times per daynot even playing any Game in the phonePhone gets heated up just like that without usage.I feel my 2years older One Plus 5 is better than the latest released 7TPlease don't buy if you are looking for good battery pack up,3,One plus7t Battery is very bad,3.0
Akash Choudhary, 30 June 2020,Starting with the delivery : I received this unit during lockdown before the allocated time. So Thank you Amazon for delivering it before hand! The Box wasn't tampered or torn.... it was intact!Demand : Even after 8 to 9 months after it's launch... this device is still popular amongst us.. even if we compare it to one plus 8. And the Price drop has made it more affordable.Looks and Feel :This device is a style statement in itself. I loved its look at the first instant itself. I'll give 9 out of 10 for its looks. The way it's smooth edges are the notification key power button and volume rocker all stand in their respective place. It feels very light in handHowever the oreo camera might be a matter of discontentment from person to person... but i love it.Smoothness and Performance:Device is very smooth.. thanks to qualcomm motherboard unit. Graphic intensive games and apps run smoothly in it. Just a slight heating when playing in high graphic settings.Screen : Amoled looks elegant with 90 hz refresh rate. It is smooth and having great ppi. and luminous intensity.UI : UI is good and simple and easy to operate. However found the UI navigation hanging at times when we navigate using the full screen setting mode.Earphones : I purchased One plus wireless Z along with this unit and after the oxygen os update... it works great with dolby atmos settings. However i do miss 3.5 mm jack... what's the problem in providing that (wired earphones still exist)Battery : Battery is a pain point .. .. have to charge it every now and then. 3800 mah is very less ..  it gives a lot of hiccups and we have to carry the charger where ever we go.,2,Magnanimous in Performance Elegant in Style !,4.0
Aakash, 30 October 2019,This is my first OnePlus device. My cousins have been using OnePlus phones (OnePlus 3 and 5T) since a long time. I was previously using the Redmi Note 4 so the jump to OnePlus was quite a big one for me. From using an entry level phone to buying a Flagship it was a giant leap. Got great discount on this phone (₹3600 off for exchanging Redmi Note 4 and ₹1700 off on ICICI card). I got the phone on 16th of October and have been using the phone ever since. I'll divide my review between the pros and consPROS:-1. BATTERY LIFE. It may seem weird but somehow because of OnePlus's optimizations I'm getting a SOT of around 6.5-7 hours. If you really try to kill the battery then also you'd get a SOT of atleast 5 hours2. PERFORMANCE. This phone absolutely flies. The SD855+ processor is a multitasking beast. No stuttering or lags whatsoever3. RAM MANAGEMENT. The RAM management on this phone is insanely good. Apps never get refreshed. Just don't enable the RAM Boost option in settings4. CAMERA. The cameras on this phone are great. Daytime photos look good with slightly increased contrast. The nightscape mode is just too good. Better than Pixels in my opinion. The Super Stable Video mode is a godsend5. SOUND QUALITY. The stereo speakers on this phone are extremely loud and clear. Dolby Atmos really works6. HAPTICS. The vibration motor on this phone is really awesome. Crisp and Precise7. CHARGING. This phone charges at a crazy fast rate. I get 0-71% in half an hour and 0-100% in 55 minutes8. DISPLAY. That 90hz refresh rate is silky smooth. You won't go back to 60hz again. Every other phone with 60hz refresh rate (iPhone Note 10+ Pixel 3 XL Mate 30 Pro etc) feels laggy after using this phone.CONS:-1. SYSTEM STABILITY. There are a few bugs here. The brightness wouldn't go to full even after you have set it to max. It'll take 1-2 seconds extra to go to full brightness. Sometimes Chrome freezes on its own.2. NO USB-C TO 3.5MM DONGLE IN BOX3. NO EARPHONES IN BOXMISCELLANEOUS:-1. The screen flickers at low brightness. Not a hardware issue. It's the nature of OLED displays. You can't see it with your naked eyes but a camera can pick it up. If it bothers you enable the DC Dimming feature2. AMOLED displays have a hard time displaying correct images on a dark grey background under low brightness. So no need to panic if you see some reddish or greenish tint on a grey backgroundOverall This is an awesome phone. No phone is perfect. Each phone has a few bugs. I have already got 2 software updates regarding system stability and camera quality. OnePlus is known to remove all bugs from their phones through software updates so no need to worry if you find some bugs.,One,Better than Pixel and Samsung Flagships,5.0
VV, 28 May 2020,"Received a non responsive product. On initial booting it asked me to choose language and then asked me to 'wipe data and cache'. Strange Considering that a NEW phone should rake you straight to set up. If that's the FIRST thing a buyer sees it really does NOT inspire confidence in the user experience.... You know what they say about first impressions. Amazon tech support was not available. More panic set in. I called 1+ tech support and they asked me to go through some trouble shooting mechanisms. Conclusion - the phone is non responsive. Called amazon techsupprt immediately and endured the 30 minute wait time. Thereafter the representative (as friendly and knowledgeable as he may be) said that the tech support team was unavailable and that I should call the next day. This morning I called the amazon tech support and went through the same troubleshooting process again. And the representative initiated the replacement. This phone may be highly acclaimed but such an experience can really leave a bitter taste.... Hopefully the new piece that comes to me now is in fact new and not just ""soap in a phone box"". I wonder if amazon is responsible or the retailer was trying to palm off some used piece... Whoever it is I hope that this feedback helps change or make the process of buying more fool-proof.",2,Perils of buying online!,1.0

sharon, 18 June 2020,I not a typical reviewer.It's just my first impression.Using OnePlus 7t for the last two weeksUI is especially so good as it's almost like stock AndroidI personally prefer stock android. That might be the reason why i like it's UI.Till now i didnt feel any lag even while using games like pubg.I can't say much about camera.. as i didnt use it properly. But still can say its beyond my expectation ( pro mode which almost help me set shutter speed iso and all manually.)About sound quality. I use OP bullet z with this phone. And with recent update sound experience have improved a lot.Battery life is okay. Can't say it's superb. It last for a day on my normal use (a few hours of pubg whatsapp calls and other app usage).Will update negetive points once i figure out some.That's all for now.Happy shopping,2,Not a typical reviewer.,5.0
Sachin, 15 October 2019,I don't know why people giving false feedback. This is the good phone from one plus at this price range.I saw most of people saying no handsfree and hard cover in mobile box but its mentioned in unboxing. so just want to tell those people that please watch that unboxing clearly. Those are review boxes only for that tech person and not a retailer box. also tech persons clearly mentioned this in their unboxing video still people asking the same question and giving wrong feedback for best of the best phone which is very wrong.,2,Better than the Best,5.0
Raghvendra j., 11 December 2019,The outer packaging was opened the manufacturer or Amazon guys didn't sealed it properly but the main box was sealed so that is good :'( delivery guy called me and told me to film it whenever I opened it just for safety because the outer packaging wasn't sealed so... But fortunately the main box was good it was sealed so yeah it goes well. big thumbs up for delivery guys. And here the phone review.1st - I'll tell you about battery it so good don't worry it won't drain fastly2nd - camera is good af3rd - fingerprint is so good quite fastDon't worry guys this phone is a Beats so go for it....and film it  I repeat :-P:-P..btw there was scratches on my screen from beginning but it's okay it on protective cover so yeah  ( the one which comes with phone)So yeah that was my experience ( quite adventure):-P,3,Savdhan rahe satark rahe ( btw phone is good af),4.0
Tushar Gaurav, 24 May 2020,Really disappointed by the quality of OLED panel 1+ provides. There is this greenish tint in greyish screen at low brightness which bother me a lot as much of my usage is at night during which one activates the dark mode the night mode and keeps the brightness at low. Somehow all the three factors aggravate the condition even more. Will look up for a replacement. If the issue still persists might go for a complete refund.Edit: I've returned the device as of now. Waiting for the replacement product. Still not dispatched.,3,Disappointed by the panel quality,1.0
Samsher Singh, 14 October 2019,Day 1: Feels premium from every aspect. Just missing the 3.5 mm Jack else it's a great masterpiece.Day 2: My entire trust in one plus is shaken to see the bugs in my 1 day old phone. Not able to answer or make calls. Lot of latency in fingerprint sensor also in accessing few drop down functions. I have requested for a replacement but this is utter disappointing to find the device malfunctioning. It was very embarrassing n problematic as I could not answer a few calls at work which were important. One plus has completely let me down. I was much better off with MI I believe.,3,Masterpiece turned into disappointment :(,1.0

Vikas Jha, 24 November 2019,At start the phone will have a nice touch and feel.But with continue usage there are multiple issue and some things that felt good earlier would also feel useless.1.Gaming experience is not good. In Pubg sometimes the touch would not work like trying to shoot but it will not respond and don't shoot. In COD many times the avatar gets stuck and the game wouldn't respond to touch. On continuous gaming heating is pretty much more than what I experienced in OnePlus 5t. Also the gaming experience was also better in 5t.Coming to network and notifications. I have observed that network quality is less than 5t. Ignoring that if we say it's provider issue. I have observed that when not using phone it is not receiving notifications. When we pick up the phone and use something that invokes internet then we start getting all the notification and messages.Coming to looks.. they won't matter because it is expensive phone so we are going to cover it with some cover for better protection and that makes it bulky which is not good.,2,Not a good option,1.0
Amazon Customer, 11 December 2019,I took the phone in the last week of November and got the 128 gb variant for 35k.The delivery was fast and the phone was delivered in good shape.It is pretty much what you would expect from OnePlus. The build is pretty premium. Comes with a transparent case inside. The buttons and screen are sturdy looking although the back and screen do attract fingerprints.The performance on this thing is flawless and is just a bit ahead of the rog2 even though the rog2 beats it in almost every other field. The 90 hertz display combined with the 855+ really defines a new standard of being smooth.Updates are timely and the oxygen OS is the standard vanilla experience although i found the unnecessary Netflix app pre-installed.Fingerprint reader is pretty quick and the camera is good too although the camera gives images slightly on the saturated side.The notch is not much of an issue.The biggest bummer is the lack of an audio jack which i think was a bad move from OP. The phone does not come with a 3.5mm adapter and you will have to buy it seperately. Although the mrp of the adapter is 390 you can enroll your device with your OP Account and get 250 off on it. I got mine for 180. It's not the most comfortable thing to use and does not have a good build quality but haven't gotten any issues yet.This packs a 3800mah battery which combined with the 90hertz display drains reasonably fast. If you don't use your phone a lot during the day it does last for a day and a half but if your screen is continuously on then will just last a day.With complete day on YouTube at 30% i had got 7 hrs of screen on time.But this won't be an issue for you if you can carry the charger. The 30watt wrapt charge is ridiculously fast. It charges from 30 to full in a little over 35 mins. Even a 10 min charge gives me around 30%.One charge in the morning for me lasts till the next day morning with 20-30% to spare.So only pick this phone if you are taking it for long use and for the snappy clean software and performance.If you are planning to take a phone for gaming choose the rog2 over it anyday. Not that it performs better than this. The performance is almost the same but it has a ton more of other features that will matter more.Overall it's a good phone.,2,A Decent phone,5.0

sagar, 19 October 2019,Penning this review after extensive use of around 10-12 days..Coming from OnePlus 3T user this is a pleasant upgrade.. 8GB Ram-256GM storageThe main USP of this phone is the display the wrap charger which is ultrafast and the performance..would never hang up on you despite innumerous apps or games..however I did see a couple of apps crashed at times..The Antutu score is around 3.5L ..which is impressive..Coming to battery when phone arrived it was at 48pc and took close to 25mins tomfull.charge with wrap.charge..With moderate to heavy usage the battery last for entire day..With the dash charger  takes a little longer but fast enough..Have hardly observed any heating issues with multiple apps open..The biggest let down though is the camera..Immediately after opening the phone from box and configuring it came an OTA update mainly for camera..Took some shots and have extensively used in last few days and shots are just normal not exceptional including the much advertised macro mode..the nightscape mode though is an exception..The auto camera settings are over saturated with red's and yellows are too warm to be real when you view them on big screen ..I hope the OnePlus team updates the camera eventually as.this is purely SW related since the hardware in paper is great and capable of shooting exceptional photos..having said that as of today the camera is equivalent to any phone in 15k-20k range...compared it with M30s and M30s came out to be better in some.occasions under similar lighting...so.if u are truly looking for a great camera don't go for it..Though the front camera was much better and photos came out naturalHowever if u trust the OnePlus communtiy n developerslike me :) this phone is simply amazing with it's screen  performance and battery ..The stock.android like experience is an icing on cake with buttery smooth feel without any lag whatsoever..Good luck!,One,The king but in mid range not flagships,4.0
Bhargavi, 5 November 2019,If you have used any phone in 20k+ budget then this Phone is pretty average. I dont obseve anything outstanding as compared to my previous honor phone.Few things i dont like on this phone -Automatic brightness for screen.. this just doesn't seem to be working when i move outdoors. Display is hardly visible with full brightness. I am yet to figure out if i can tweak this thing. Until now it's a bad experience to use the phone in sunlight.Camera... Not great at all. The only area this phone outperforms is the quality of night-light photos ... Like the diwali lights decor and shooting buildings at night .. small tiny moon in the backdrop... Except these ones.... All other photos are below average terrible saturation of reds!Image stabilization is very bad. I have used a Moto G4+ in the past for shooting outdoor landscapes at Ladakh while I was riding a bike on those tough terrains.... There were hardly any blur photos. This phone can't even get a decent photo in the hand unless using the 48MP in normal mode. I'm not at all happy abt their Hybrid-Image-Stabilization.Selfie camera is pretty bad too.. cant get a wide angle and depth effect like in other phones.The phone freezes sometimes .. with 8GB RAM? My old phone had only 4GB and never froze once! Something's not going good inside this phone.Missing the 3.5mm audio jack a lot :(Something's i like abt the phone - watching videos indoors.. good display. The faster screen refresh rate is definitely a good experience.Oh and the warp charger... I just love it!,One,Not worth the hype.,3.0
SbBlr90, 29 November 2019, Another well made product from OnePlus I have been using Oneplus series from their First Smartphone and this is my 4th one 7T has everything speed display quality RAM Latest Android security and Oxygen OS smooth as butter minimal yet fill with futures.I upgraded to 7T from OnePlus 5 which still performs like any of the new mobile available in the market I miss LED notification in 7T and the screen is bit too long for my liking because of the big screen battery backup is not as good as in Oneplus 5 but the Warp Charge makes up for it with quick and fast charging.Overall a good phone for every one.Go get it you wont regret it.,2,Great Phone from OnePlus,5.0
shivam, 6 May 2020,Little retrospect. I was using Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 for the past two years. Now coming to this phone.Pros:Very organized software: Everything is intuitive. I was used to samsung experience so this software feels a hell less cluttered. Even comparing to one ui I feel oxygen os is better.Camera: Simply the best camera u can get at this price point! Night mode ultrawide stabilization is all very good.Performance: Snapdragon 855+ and oxygen os. Nothing to say anymore.Battery: Excellent battery optimization. Even though I have pinned some apps in the ram and am a heavy user 5+ hours of screen on time is consistent.Speaker and call reception: all very excellent.Face unlock: works 100% of the time and is really very fast.Cons:Missing Always on Display: ambient display in one plus serves no purpose at all.Buggy Software: it will seem odd to you but after using this phone for about 2 months i am confused why other people wont mention it. There are some minor glitches that keep appearing in this phone. Sometimes the status bar will just disappear until it's restarted. Gaming mode causes problems with some games like the moving parts in the game will disappear and won't correct unless the game is restarted. Screen freezes are very common. And some more little things that become irritating over time.Fingerprint scanner: works maybe 60% of the time.If anything is not mentioned it's because everything else is just fine.,2,Good phone overall atleast for the price. Not flagship level!,5.0

Sundeep, 25 May 2020,GENUINE REVIEW: Quality of One Plus 7t is bad as compared to its previous models + not upto mark as compared to other competitive models.The battery life is poor and I have to charge my mobile in each 5 hours.Both camera qualities are not good. Cannot understand if it needs hardware or software improvement!The memory management is too bad. Although I have quite free RAM memory & storage but still different apps keep crashing through out the day producing crash logs. Most of the times screen goes black or crash whole OS where you need to reboot the device while playing Amazon video. One day the mobile got complete blackout and I searched for One Plus community blog and based on couple of other user's instructions and long press on power/volume button to restart the mobile. A mobile device shouldn't behave like this if it is new. I used so many Android devices earlier for atleast 2-3 years and this is the worst one with this higher price.,2,GENUINE REVIEW: Not upto mark poor battery life poor camera quality Bad memory management,2.0
Mallajeet Sonowal, 10 October 2019,I replaced 3T with this masterpiece 7T. I had been using 3T for the last two and a half years and was planning to continue using it for another one or two years as 3T is still a beast as on date but unfortunately my 3T was dropped in a swimming pool and so i replaced my 3T with this amazing phone. When you are accustomed to using Oxygen OS nothing can replace the feeling and satisfaction. I have been using this 7T for last 3 days and i just want to give a quick overview of likes (which are many) and dislikes ( a very few)  as below:Likes:1. Display is amazing with 90 hz refresh rate.2. Android 10 out of the box with new features.3. Excellent photos along with Supermacromode in camera.4. Zen mode with new customizable time periods.5. Butter smooth performance. No lagging or heating at all during multitasking or gaming.Dislikes:1. i am very dissappointed with the Nightscape mode. The picture you take in nightscape is unsatisfactory. Even though the camera manages to take the extra light but it lacks the originality and is less subtle especially when you snap a persons photo in very low light its felt like colour mush evrywhere. Infact  to my surprise i found that low light photography is very good without using nightscape. Except this i liked the camera quality very much.2. battery is average may be becoz of the 90 hz refresh rate for e.g on average to heavy usage if i start the day with 100% battery at 7 am  the phone manages to retain 10 to 20% battery by 7 to 8 pm.Anyways  overall i am very happy with the upgrade and glad to be a part of the one plus family again. infact in our family we have OP6 OP6T OP7 and now OP7T 🤗🤗🥰🥰,One,Best in the Price Range,5.0
Manish B., 24 October 2019,The phone is snappy everything is good and there are many review already so i am just informing the negative aspects:1. Software is having some bugs frequent app crash and freeze2. Battery life is pretty average and gives screen on time of around 4.5 to 5 hours on moderate to heavy usage3. Camera quality is average warm or yellowish pictures taken by camera4. Video quality is averageOverall its a good phone but OnePlus needs to improve by software updates,One,Good product,4.0

Deepdarshan, 28 October 2019,I upgraded from one plus 7 to 7T and it's a good decision overall thoughts on 7T.At the cost what they are selling it's definitely a good deal.The best part of the phone is it's display and the sound to be honest I don't feel any difference between 60 hz and 90 hz and who cares because the display brightness and color production in 7T is  excellent the phone when you take to outdoors the display looks just like indoors because of the excellent brightness levels which is 1000 NITs. You would love watch movies or any content on this superb display.Sound clarity and the volume levels simply the best you don't feel like using headphones or need external source. It's so Crystal clear that you often wonder how's it possible to produce such crisp sound on a smart phone definitely better than one plus 7 though both have stereo speakers this is of a different level.Battery back up is good but I felt one plus 7 was better yes it charges from 0 to 100 in 1 hour and the charging port is tad tight.On Camera yes it has 2 additional lens one telescopic and one ultra wide apart from primary lens yes it does do the work of what it's meant for  but the processing is moderate the noise levels are seen I felt one plus 7 takes better photos compared to 7t I might be wrong here.The look and feel is top notch the Oreo camera actually enhances the looks and I see everywhere people buying blue because that's what the reviewers get from One plus for 256gb you have only blue color but the fact is that Grey or the Fostered Silver is very Good looking than blue and it looks more premium.The face unlocking and finger scanner is fast face unlocking does work even in dark with the screen light falling on the face.One not so feel good factor is with the haptic motor it's week they shouldn't have rather put it but overall it's very good phone,One,The display and the speaker are the 2 stand out feature to go for this.,4.0
Common, 30 June 2020,I am glad that I bought this OnePlus 7T and it is just amazing!! I assure you  it's the best choice for this price range.What I like is it has nearly all the features that OnePlus 7 Pro gives ( and more including outstandingly better macro camera and Snapdragon 855+) and that too at much less price. The camera quality is very nice as you can see. Yes it struggles in low light but still it's much better. However battery is 3800 mAh still it gives a very decent battery backup at 90Hz because of its optimised oxygen os and fluid amoled display.If you are a gamer you are going to have a very amazing experience. The graphics are a feast to the eye. It's so fast  I just love it.The Os is highly customisable and you can design it however you want. The Zen mode provides you a break and lets you enjoy life. Reading Mode is fantastic. The look is very premium.Overall if your budget is under 40k  this is the best choice. Period.,2,The best smartphone for this price range.,5.0
Amazon Customer, 12 October 2019,Absolutely worst Product it is heating up very badly with in few minutes.Amazon promises to have return or replacement but now they are Refusing there own principles.Not recommend will share the actual performance in next few days.as mentioned Pre applied screen protector is missing on my phone which is delivered to me,3,Don't Waste,1.0
Nityanand Bhat, 2 January 2020,Since oneplus 3T I am a regular user of One Plus. I used one plus 5t Oneplus 6 One plus 7 and now one plus 7t. Out of all I did not like 7T. To be frank One Plus 7 was much much better than 7T.1. Fingure print censor doesnt work all time2. Battery drains out before noon ( pls note that I dont play games I dont watch Videos much and I dont play songs).3. Most of the features are repeated from One Plus 7. But rear camera of One plus 7T is much better ( I am not telling one plus 7 camera was bad. It was really good... But this camera is better than one plus 7)4. Speed is best. I have 8GB RAM. Really good.Overall when compared to 7 7T is an average phone.,2,One Plus 7T is an average phone,3.0
Gaurav Shrivastava, 6 October 2019,Writing this review after using it for a day.Camera - No doubt this is best one for camera. i tried taking pictures in every light(day night afternoon) and believe me this stands par from others. Didnt want to carry DSLR for my travels hence landed up at this. I am fully satisfied.Fingerprint sensor - Bit slow but pretty much acceptable. This doesn't mark phone in negative side.Battery - It ran for more than a day for me. I clicked around 50 pics saw 10 videos did setup of numerous app in this phone after one time charge and still it ran for more than a day. So i am happy with that.90/60 htz - I shifted to 60 hts and performance was good enough.Charging - Fastest ever seen.App opening time - Very fast impressive.Memory- I can see 256 total available memory. So its not like other phones which shows 223 available out of 256 GB.Sound - Excellent. Enjoyed playing videos on YT and Savn app.Earphone Jack - Bought a type C converter from local market(PimpriPune) for INR 80 and it did the job well.Body Cover - It looks like a normal cover. Doesn't hold mobile tightly. I would change that to a better one soon. I see some good covers are launching on 20th October for INR 599. They looks superb and rigid.,2,Overall best,5.0
Davis j c, 8 October 2019,Initially my first choice was to go for the rog phone 2 which had similar price pointsBut then I realized that paying money for the things which we are not going to use frequently is madness.Of course in specs the rog phone 2 looks like a heavyweight.But those are for the people who have never used one plus.First of allI got my 7t on the Amazon's Great Indian festival which gave me a discount of 2000 RS which is equal to the rog phone 2(yes u get a discount for 2k but it was out of stock)Secondly both phone's do not support sd cardsince that I made one plus 7t my cup of tea.There is a difference between the 90hz and the 120hz display.But why pay for those if u are not a professional gamer.The camera on the 7t is way more good than the rog phone 2.The design is made for professionals and not gamers.Then comes the softwareOne plus 7t ships with Android 10 out of the box which is great.This is the first phone to get Android 10 even before the pixel 4.Then comes the battery lifeI have been using this phone for the past 5 days and I barely charge this device if I am using it at 60hz (that's smoother than the k20 pro).For 90hz display u will get a screen on time of around 6 if u are a regular user.For charging speeds the 7t gets the wrap 30t which is insanely fast. It took me around 58 mins to charge the phone from 0-100 which is definitely the best in the market.Call quality and signal reception is good even when there is no proper signal reception on my brothers k20 pro.Face unlock is faster and the fingerprint reader is also improved.Oxygen 0s!!!!!! Belive me If u switch to oxygen osthen clearly u will never back off .For a regular user who does gaming very often the performance is top notch the snapdragon 855 plus can handle anything at ease.Overall one plus has offered a complete packageFinallyI have no regrets in buying this phone over the rog phone 2........,2,Overall package,5.0
Saahil sharma, 27 June 2020,Got it delivered on 23/6/20i was confused between op8 and 7t. After thinking so much i concluded that 7t is a best pick right now cos Op8 is a overpriced device cos of 5g and believe me in india till now 4g is not working perfectly than how could you expect 5g to come that soon. I guess 5g is not coming till 2 years atleast than why spend 8k extra now? At the price tag of 34k i got SD855+ 90hz displaywarp chargetriple cameras which are working really nice as expected. So i think currently its the best device in this price tag. I am disappointed only in the matter of ip rating which is also missing in op8. And one more thing op8 has the curved screen which is very expensive to replace if you break it and curved screens are also very very fragile and they are also prone to accidental side touches. So i think 7T is a much better option than op8 and its even 8K cheaper 😅,2,Better than One plus 8 at the price tag of 34K,4.0
Amazon Customer, 24 June 2020,This is the very first time that I had such bad experience wd Amazon..Never expected this from such a brand..I hv received the phone on 22nd June n on dat very day I noticed the phone has booting problem registered it wd Amazon they said a wdout a technician's survey dey can't do anything scheduled it for 25th June now in Assam lockdown is going on various places...

stenardt, 3 May 2020,Pro :Excellent Screen 1080p 90hzBattery life 7 hr screen on time usage(but fast charging makes up for it).Type-CCharging time 70 percent increase in 25 minutes (after 3 months).Clean UI No Bloatware.Cons:Default Camera Ok(Use Gcam mod)Getting to much ads on youtube more than other phones (but don't know whether this phones fault or not)Camera bump is too big.No head phone jack. No earphones included in boxThe phone is like one plus 7 but better screen(high refresh rate 90hz good for gaming) Larger Battery slightly better camera.,2,Excellent phone for 33500 inr,5.0
Om Singh, 8 October 2019,Camera clearity is very poor speakers are defective they are making weird noise similar to raditiation sound. Overall worthless to spend 40k. They are not even ready to refund.,6,Poor camera and sound quality,1.0
Sahil Vasudev, 17 June 2020,Oneplus is indeed great brand and i am using it for last 4+ years and i am die hard fan of oneplus.I expected oneplus 7T another masterpiece from oneplus but the things are not so great this time.Pros:1. Stylish look with oneplus brand label.2. Smooth touch due to 90hz refresh rate.3. Very high end processor from SD making it high performer even while multitasking and gaming.4. Great combination including RAM and ROM which is necessary and making it smooth going for 2-3 years.5. Fingerprint sensor is really good and quick working very fast and accurate.Cons:1. Finishing is in polycarbon with only side aluminum frame while before lower models from oneplus had metallic finishing.2. Smooth Liquid Touch came at expense of your battery drainage causing battery to drain much faster than expected thus forcing you to keep refresh rate at 60Hz.3. Camera quality is not so good needs more focus for clicking nuce pics otherwise most of times pics goes blur.4. Face Unlock only scans your iris/eyes only while other competitive brands of oneplus scan your full face and other face points.5. No 3.5mm jack making your old wired earphones to rust.,0,Great phone but worth if under 30K,4.0
Harpreet Singh, 15 June 2020,I was soo excited today that I would be getting to lay hands on this beast of a phone. Got the delivery promptly as expected and in good package. Ideally I would have liked such items to be delivered in a box rather than the usual Amazon envelope. Though the envelope was sealed properly probably to avoid any tampering before delivery.I had unboxed it and it had all the items namely scratchless Phone Good transparent phone cover and charging adaptor and sim removal tool along with other documents.So far so good. Then starts the ordeal. The phone failed to boot and got stuck on the Image1 attached here for long time. I felt it has entered some recovery mode when on next press of Power button the next options Image 2 with one reading English appeared. By now I was almost sure there is some issue with the phone but still out of hope and belief that it can't happen with me I clicked on English and page as shown in Image 3 appeared. Then I thought against going ahead and called customer service for replacement.I have shared the details with them and they assured me that by end of the day I should be getting the delivery date of replacement phone and this headset will be picked up at the time of delivery. Ideally I would have liked the same-day delivery as their warehouse is very close to my area but the customer service executive mentioned that since it is more than 20k it would require some approvals.I am now hoping first to get the replacement as soon as possible and that the replacement works well unlike this one. Really disappointed with OnePlus to have delivered a faulty phone but I am hoping that Amazon helps me out as usual with their prompt and normally very good customer service.Hope to give a detailed review when I receive a working phone and I am hopeful it will happen soon. Once again a shout out to Amazon for prompt Customer service. Hopefully I will get the phone by tomorrow and the mood changes from current gloom state to rejoice.,One,Awaiting replacement for Faulty phone received which isn't booting,1.0
Dr Rajesh, 7 July 2020,"""A thing of beauty is a joy forever'""Jack of all trades master of all'""Bold and beautiful""""Pure temptation""This phone is so beautiful elegant and buttery smooth that you will feel addicted to this masterpiece and it will be a cynosure for all eyes. OnePlus has truly shown it's microengineering skills while manufacturing this OnePlus 7t.I did a lot of research for 2 months before buying a new phone. This is true VFM phone.Pros.1. Processor.Snapdragon 855+ is flawless and needs no further description. All high graphic games run ultrasmoothly. Phone automatically shifts to game mode while playing games.2. Display.6.55 inch HDR 10+ fluid amoled 90 Hz display is always vibrant and soothing to view. It has colour enhancement feature for videos and it is amazing.As per me its 6.55 inch size is perfect to hold.Avoid phones of display of 6.7 as they are bulky and difficult to hold. You will never use IPS display again once you will hold this phone.3. Body design/built quality - Ergonomic designed aluminium alloy body with Corning Gorilla glass 5 on both sides. Premium feel in hands. Also it comes with free good quality transparent protector case4. Camera- It is simply amazing. Macroshots are fabulous. (See images)Slow motion video recording is excellent in natural lighting. Inside the rooms you will notice darkness and screen flickering.5 . Speaker- Dolby Atmos certified speakers both at above and below are loud and gives a mesmerizing experience while watching multimedias.6. Touch response/fingerprint scanner/faceunlock-Phone gets unlocked in a fraction of second. Touch is buttery smooth.7. Haptic feedback- So soothing experience just like an iPhone.8. Battery- Battery is good but not excellent. However 30W wrap charger is so fast that it charges my phone from 0 to 50% in 20 minutes. So battery is not a major issue and I can easily get 12 hours of usage time.Also battery optimization is amazing.I was worried about its battery life before buying it as most of the persons have given bad reviews regarding its battery. But believe me wrap charger makes things simpler.9. Internet call quality and Wifi- Excellent10.Oxygen OS- Best ever. I was using a mi phone before and miui OS was just very bad. Believe me oxygen OS is without any annoying ads and is so easy to use.11. Extra featuresGray scale- this feature turns phone display to black and white and it looks amazing as well.Side slider switch- It is an added feature like in iphonesCons- Not seen yetFinal verdict- I am not a technical person. I have never bought a phone of more than 18000 in my life. But honestly saying spending 38000 on a 256 gb device like this is worth. It is an Android iPhone...:-)Blindly go for it. I myself had wasted a lot of months on deciding which phone to buy.",0,Bold beautiful and cynosure for all eyes,5.0
Dr Imkong, 5 October 2019,Received my phone 12hrs ago..... Here's my initial impressions. (Was in a dilemma between this and the ROG2... But since I don't game at all and the styling was a bit too loud for my taste I went ahead with this classic beauty I spite of the battery life and other obvious advantages).PROs1) Awesome built quality... I like the in hand feel of the phone and it's possible (not comfortable though) to use it with one hand if ur hands r big enough.2) Screen is amongst the best I've seen and used (used a super amoled on Samsung previously). There's a screen guard pre installed and I didn't feel the need to remove it as it didn't hinder my fingerprint or input via the touchscreen.3) Software is a total gem.... It's clean and with no bloatware whatsoever.4) I personally like the alert slider... Its quite handy for me.5) Performance is buttery smooth and RAM management has been done well. The apps stay in memory all the time.(I tried with 7 apps open at the same time). Since I don't play games of any sort I didn't test it out.6) Speakers are good...its loud enough and clear at the same time.7) Camera is a mixed bag. It's good enough for social media and with a lil bit of editing u can take some real good pics but don't expect top tier level quality. So maybe photo buffs should consider a different phone with a great camera.8) Charging speed is a beast... Nothing else comes close.CONS1) lack of a headphone jack is a real bummer for me... Especially since my Bluetooth headset (Sony Mdr-xb650BT) doesn't seem to connect no matter what I try.2) The gestures are a hit and miss at the moment maybe it'll improve with time but so far am not enjoying it. And the software buttons while typing messages u accidentally type the home button which leads to the home screen and makes the typing experience really annoying. So sticking with gestures in this one.3) Battery life could be a problem. I was using it in the 90hz mode when I received it and within 1 Hr battery dropped by over 16%...... So 90hz is cool and all but I've reverted back to 60hz refresh rate to see by how much the battery performance improves. Will test it more in the following days and decide based on the result.So those are my very early initial impressions. Maybe I'll update after couple of weeks time for a more detailed review.Enjoy the device👍,2,Awesome product for the money👍,4.0
Hammad, 5 October 2019,First of all... please don't judge on using OP2🤣🤣...it was(is) a very good phone and it made it to almost 4 years with me....I got it a few months after it was launched and it was a beast back then..(it can even compete with a lot present phones....I'm just saying 😁)...now coming back to 7T....I was really amazed after holding the phone in my hand...it is much much much better in real life than in pics and videos... really slim..great build quality... amazing design (personal preference)...buttons are great...good vibration motor..and then we have THE DISPLAY..it's amazing that's all I can say...it's absolutely smoooooth.. because of the 90Hz refresh rate... although it has a yellowish tint to it... viewing angles are okayish...face detection and fingerprint scanner are on point..... charging is super fast... overall functioniong is also really fast and snappy...all in all it's a great phone at this price point....but I am not that happy with Amazon..it took almost a week for this package to reach me...and on top of that it came in a plastic packaging without even bubble wrapping the phone's box... I'll suggest you to record your unboxing just to avoid any problem!,One,My initial impressions after switching from OnePlus 2 to 7T,5.0
Rinju francis, 9 February 2020,Using the phone for last 50 days.1- Battery is below average may last about 8-10 hrs for avg useag.2- Camara looks very good. But picture is very bad. Missing too much in picture.3- Application crashes several times sometimes the inbuilt apps will not open and will show (can't open). Then need to reebot the device.4- I feel that it was better to purchase any other China makers after using it for this much.5- The positive thing is that I got 1+ lable on back side and 3 big camera in a circle.,2,I fall into a cheep phone with a brand emblem,1.0
Sourav Ganguly, 31 May 2020,My first OnePlus and I am loving it.It's been 4 days I have been using the phone and below are my pros and cons.Pros...1) very good display. For display 5/52) Snapdragon 855+ is very fluid and with Android 10 it works very efficiently. So performance 5/5.3) I know many are complaining about battery life not good however as per my observation if you keep the display at 90 hz refresh rate the battery is bound to be draining fast. If you are travelling and won't get any power socket for many hours I would suggest to keep the refresh rate at 60 hz it will really improve battery performance.4) Charging 5/5. With warp charge 30t the charging is absolutely brilliant.5) Camera 5/5. I have read reviews where people are complaining about camera quality being blur however I have not faced any such issues. It's true that it takes a little bit of time to adjust the focus however the camera samples are pretty good. I even use a DSLR so know a little bit about adjusting the focus. My tip use grid lines for better focussing.6) Looks 5/5. Looks are really premium. However I would suggest anyone buying this phone to compulsory have a good rugged case because it is important to protect this from scratches. It's true a rugged case will make the phone look bulgy but I am ok with that.Cons1) No 3.5 mm jack and OnePlus does not provides an adapter as well in the box. According to me it's an essential item as with the low availability of type c headphones I think a 3.5 mm adapter in the box would have been very helpful.2) video output on phone looks brilliant however when taken to laptop it looks way too much over saturated. My suggestion to OnePlus is to fix this issue with an update because the video performance comes nowhere to the still pictures performance. If the issue is not fixed than it would really dwarf the phones still pics capability and would lead to a bad review.My suggestion if anyone looking to buy OnePlus go for the 7t  without any doubt if you like the looks because looks are subjective to one's personal liking. As for me I love the looks.,0,Brilliant phone I love the product..,5.0
Ashish Verma, 26 November 2019,There is nothing positive to write about the phone except the camera. Battery drains so quickly. I was using Nokia 8.1 before its battery lasted sometime for 2 days Nothing changed and with 1+7t battery drains within half a day. Couple of updates have already happened but no change. Response is average. Overall bad decision but after spending so much money have to use it for a while as no resale value..,3,Except camera nothing else upto mark,3.0
RAHUL MORJE, 4 January 2020,My ratings for One plus T phone1) Poor selfie camera2) sound quality is poor.3) Battery Should be more powerful4) Speaker sound is irritatingSuggestion:-1) Camera should be of high resolution with Sony CMOS and Carl zeiss lense.2) Onboard digital to analog processor required 32 bit Hi res sound support is must.  Use ESS sabre Digital analog processor.3) 4500 mah battery required.4) Use Bang & Olufson speakers and onboard amplifier. Or Use Fiio technology.. Sound should be smooth and laidback. ( Zero Ear Fatigue),One,Massive improvement required.,4.0
Girish Kamble, 6 October 2019,I received only the ohone and clear plastic case. Package didn't contain earphones and not did it contain 3 back covers as being shown in many unboxing YouTube videos. So I am not sure why online purchases have not been able to get their ear plugs and 3 back cover cases. Or was it a tampered Package from the seller- would be good if someone can confirm this to me. Bought during 29.9 to 4.10 salePhone works like a fast machine. Camera could have been bit better for nightmode.,2,Great phone but no earplugs or 3 back covers received in package,4.0
Soumya, 5 June 2020,Despite of OP 8 series at 35k OP 7T is still the phone to buy if you have the budget.Pros:1.Display topped with 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone gorgeous & buttery smooth.2.Oxygen Os is simply the best possible android skin out there & is also customizable.3.Camera: I don't know about critics. But this triple lens camera is something. Super Macro mode & Nightscape mode is on another level. Thanks to the 2X telephoto lens. The contrast level is slightly high but I like them nevertheless.4.30T warp charge. The relatively low capacity 3800mah battery can charge up insanely fast. Use a 30 min charge anytime during your schedule & u get a 61% boost up.5.Host of other features like haptic feedback slider button etc.Cons:1.Durability : be cautious & buy a good protective back cover.2.Battery : Although it gives a 7 hour screen on time which is relatively good & can last a day for gamers & binge watchers carry a powerbank as backup. This is not a con.Verdict: Hands down this is the best oneplus phone till date.If you need a phone that can lasts longer perform daily jobs smoothly takes good pictures this phone is good enuf.Thank you.,0,Still the phone to buy in 2020!,5.0
sonu, 10 November 2019,I am a hard-core android fellow except my iPad I never entered the apple ecosystemI used almost 11 different android phones over past 10 years right from cheapest Xiaomi to costly Galaxy S series.OnePlus always fascinated me since it's launch however I always gave preference to brand value and user reviews so I neglected it for quiet few time but with the advent of 90 Hz refresh rate on phone amoled I seriously couldn't resist myself to buy the phone on the very first week of it's launch..This is my review after using it for 1 monthProsScreen size and crispy displayWarp 30T charge (I think that's the best part)Super snappy every thing is so smooth and fast as described in the captionBuilt quality/design pretty practical and upto the mark for a flagshipConsBattery life  even with moderate usage u have to plug it in 1 day or the very next day early morningAutoadaptive display is a painit never adjust itself as per the ambient lightBig size not suited for small hands definitely not for ladiesCamera are just like elephant tooth- good for nothingmy last phone was with single camera(S7 edge) and it can beat these 3 cameras in any light conditionsGestures also function poorlySo to conclude I am not really happy with the phone and it can't be compared with flagship OnePlus has their own niche of cheap flagships but in my opinion now they are directed towards money making rather than listening to the consumersI would suggest people to buy Xiaomi flagship insteadSry for this never ending review,One,U can't call it a flagship 🤭,3.0
Amazon Customer, 5 November 2019,Caution: check with microscopic view for any discoloring or dent. Mine I missed and on starting to use screen started flickering and gone completely within a day. Unfortunately I had time to setup and send couple of sms only not even a call:)Worst quality of phone.On raising complaint with Amazon the technician mentioned he can’t recommend for return as there is dent at an odd angle and Explained nothing can be done from his end because of it. I am sure I did not drop the phone so a deadlock. Now my only option is to take to service center within 2 days of purchase.I would not recommend this phone to anyone also would never purchase one from this brand in the future.,2,Worst quality don’t buy,1.0
Krishna, 9 January 2020,This is the fastest phone I've ever laid my hands on. I never thought speed would make such a difference. Mid range phones are very good these days making flagship phones less attractive. But this phone is just so fast it makes all that extra money you put in worthwhile. This phone will be good for 3 years easily just because of the specs and power. You can directly upgrade from this phone to a good foldable in 3 years. Stock camera disappoints sometimes in certain scenarios but gcam comes to the rescue. You cannot blindly open the stock cam in an urgent situation. Keep both and use whichever you think will suit the situation. That's the only minor problem with this phone. Also the fingerprint reader isn't perfect. I suggest registering each of your fingers twice to improve results. Otherwise everything is perfect. Screen battery life performance speakers charging speed UI in hand feel and touch response. It's all 5 out of 5! The price is the cherry on the cake. I don't know why people are still buying Note 10s and Pixels. This phone has everything at half the price. I have a pixel too and honestly I liked the software of the Oneplus better! It's that clean. 128 gb is more than enough for most people.For 33K this phone is a steal. If this is your first time with OnePlus and doubting the brand. Just don't. The phone comes with 2 year warranty and free pick up and drop for any service issues.

@n1l, 4 June 2020,mind blowing phone in OnePlus series at an average price...Pros...1.  different rear look particularly with camera section...2.  good metallic built...3.  easy in handling...4.  above average battery backup...5.  beast in sound coupled with good bass treble bla bla (u will be rock on)...6.  excellent clear piks due to triple lens phenomena...7.  spontaneous with face unlock...8.  gets completed charge in @ 55 minutes and no heating issues...9.  processor is also too good and push the multitasking to be lightening fast...Con...1.  battery cud have been better from 3800mah to 4500mah...still does not embarrass to that much extent...still average use makes it to go atleast 24 Hr...so did I give only 4...,One,A Beast and King in all OnePlus phones...,5.0

N.S.A, 30 October 2019,Disappointed with the product...Basic apps hang a lot.. Like calling app blacks out...What's app still hangs even after 8 months of continuous software updates... If i send more than 2 pictures in WhatsApp the whole screen blacks out. Reboot is the only temporary fix.. Meanwhile my OnePlus 2 which I have given to my mom still works like charm... Totally disappointed with OnePlus 7T,2,Disappointed with 7T,1.0
Harsh Joshi, 3 October 2019,Loving the new OP 7t.Using it since 4 days now.. here are my 2 cents:Looks and feels amazing to hold grips fine.Proccessing is fantastic truly one of the best. Multitasking on a smart phone never been better.Display is impecible 90 hz gives a whole new smooth browsing experience night mode really helps the eyes for long usage.Camera is one of its best feature for sure I mean such great image quality and macro mode is a winner. Loved it!Battery is on the lower side but hey wrap charger is so fast that u don't mind that much. 20 mins of charge and  you are good to go. Feels magical how fast it charges.OnePlus could have given basic accessories in the box like headphone convertor. Have to buy them separately.Amazon delivery got late by a day but it's okay. Felt like a tease 😏Overall the best you can get with their price.. go for it! #Oneplus7t,2,It's a very 'smart' smart phone,5.0
Ali farhan, 17 October 2019,Paid full amount in one go Worst speakers ever  hardly getting the voice of the person on the other side  very low quality speakers... hanging all the time cant use basic apps like whatsapp and instagram way too expensive phone price is not justifying the quality.. huge disappointment..Bad experience..Replacement requested but no response.. blooddy cheaters,4,Bad experience huge disappointment..,1.0
Ashish R, 3 January 2020,I love the device. Its performance speakers and camera quality are much better compared to oneplus 5. The fingerprint reader has serious issues. It does not recognize the finger at once despite registering multiple times. There are apps which require F/p sign in and they work well. This indicates maybe the f/p scanner is fine but Oxigen OS has some bug. I downloaded Amazon diagnosis software and it detected the phone to be working well. But am still not satisfied with the F/p scanner. It works only in 20% of the scans.,One,Fingerprint Reader on Screen is Faulty,4.0
AM, 16 March 2020,Quality of voice during phone calls. Whether normal whether speaker or headphones. It is so bad that I don't recall a single call ever with this phone of even half decent quality.Either One Plus 7 T just sucks or I have been sold a fake or one that did not pass quality control so got sold to poor 3rd world souls like me because there is no control or recourse for junk and crap made with jugaad sold in desh.My Motorola X Play was much much better - served me very well with less than half the price for many years. Never had voice quality issues.I regret buying this. Even with battery problem my old Motorola X-play was much better.,2,Can someone from One Plus call me. I cannot make a single decent call,1.0
anil parmar, 26 May 2020,First time i bought one plus  after delivery i  box and started intialize the phone. During initialize i faced the following problems1. not successfully initialize  it was stuck on updating part. I tried 3 to 4 hours but not sucessed.2. Bettery drain so fast and phone continuously heating.I called amazon care  got no response and  took helpvia chat  but did not get positive response. Finally i took help from one plus care via chat one plus guided me that first you have to factory reset the phone and then start initialize phone again. I did this and finally phone started to breath.I don't know why factory reset is needed in new phone.so guys this is my experience about phone.,One,Not Good Experience,3.0
manish shah, 11 October 2019,Pros : 1. Premium design - all glass and metal build which looks awesome and feels very premium in hand.2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.P.S. Purchased thru Amazon prime and got SBI disc of 2000.,One,Best one plus device till now.,5.0
Sathish P., 5 October 2019,I read a lot review about this phone and decided to buy this and bought it within10 minutes post launch. And my expectations were so high and it's been a week since got the phone did this phone fulfill all my expectations? Let's discuss it in the pros and cons section.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - fluidic UI experience the widgets are really precise and upto the point.2. Camera - super macro is not just a specification on paper it really makes wonder. Primary camera and front camera are both best in class.3. Snapdragon 855+ - Multitasking don't worry gaming don't worry WebEx meetings don't worry this guy can handle everything. Lightening fast processor.4. 90hz refresh rate - the fluidic display is another feature that's not merely on paper. Can feel the smoothness in the display. And hdr videos are a bliss to watch in 90hz5. Design - the design of the phone is premium I personally liked the circular camera socket. It makes the phone look like a beast.6. Complementary pouch: the silicon pouch provided with the phone is best in quality and it enhances the look of the phone friosted silver looks well on the transparent cover.Cons:Battery: it comes with 3800 mAh on regular usuage the battery last only a day and 5-9 hours can't one plus come with 5000 mAh battery?Fingerprint scanner: I feel the finger print scanner is not the fastest. However the face unlock is lightening fast almost no delay.Overall: OnePlus is known for providing best user experience and it has taken miles ahead with the launch of OnePlus 7T. Despite the fact that OnePlus 7 is not real value for money it compensated the users expectations with 7T. 7T I would say best flagship phone with 855+ processor.Go for it guys.,One,My review after using it for a week,5.0
Apoorva Katiyar, 30 November 2019,I am writing this review after almost using this product for a month.Camera and processor everything is nice.But I have been facing two issue - BATTERY DRAINAGE and HEATING.1. I have to charge it twice in 24hour. This is when I keep my brightness to almost minimum usage is only for 4g and listening music via non-Bluetooth earphones.In case I connect to Bluetooth Earphones then battery drainage is even quicker (so I avoid it)2. During video calling I noticed that phone starts heating heavily.I avoid using the phone while charging because I noticed heavy heating issue then as well (which I completely understand),One,All good except for battery drainage and eventual heating issues (Review after one month of usage),4.0
Ram Subramanian, 7 November 2019,The best in class premium smartphone. Display and performance awesome to the core. Wrap charge 30T is more than enough it will charge your phone upto 90% in 30 mins. Triple camera gives excellent images and does it's job even in low light condition. In-display fingerprint scanner is perfect and is faster as like physical scanner. I was a OnePlus 3 user after that I used other brands as well and finally back to OnePlus again. Except battery everything is top notch. This can be improved in upcoming software updates. No more second thought to book this phone.,One,King of smartphone - OnePlus 7T,5.0

Jairam, 3 June 2020,Worth every penny. Trust me it's enough for anyone out there many try to buy OnePlus 8 or 8 pro but you won't need that at the end it's just a mobile and you no need to spend like 55k on a mobile. U can assure you that this device is nothing less than a pro version.  You get a powerful chip and a powerful software to hardware integration just like Apple. You get everything .  And coming to the heat issue I did not found any on my device.  Everything is so perfect. If you are thinking to buy just go for it.  Trust me when you have this device in your hands you will feel the same like me,2,WORTH EVERY PENNY,5.0
Nikhil, 2 October 2019,First day of using the 7T. Though most of the features were available with other flagship phones and at a much cheaper price I went ahead with Oneplus thanks to my flawless experience with OP5 for 2.5 years.Coming to the performance of the phone the standout aspect would be the 90Hz refresh rate. The phone just seems to run so much smoother than its competitors. Other aspects would be the camera (obviously) dash charging(which definitely improved over Oneplus 5 and the aspect ratio of the screen which is just perfect. I feel the phone is heavier than the previous one I have used but this is not an issue at all.Will update after a few weeks as I explore the phone more as it is still too early to give a definitive review of the phone. So far I'm loving the phone and I believe Oneplus has delivered yet again.,2,A definite step up over all of its' predecessors!,5.0
Vikram V, 7 March 2020,My second OnePlus device (the first one was the OnePlus TVbwhich was a big letdown!). The battery life of the phone is quite good and gives me 2 whole days on my use (4G is always on bluetooth rarely extensive calls not much video). Also even with the battery saver on the performance of the display is very smooth (60Hz refresh rate and not 90Hz though that is available too). Since there is no 3.5mm headphone jack music quality with USB earphones or even bluetooth ones suffers a bit (not an issue with the phone but just that accessories don't make the cut). Fingerprint reader is a big dud and one has to press many times at times for it to unlock. Not much of a camera buff and hence can't really comment on that. The few pictures that I took did come out well,0,Decent phone good battery life fingerprint scanner a big dud!,4.0
Suchin Pati, 23 October 2019,My two primary drivers before this was the Poco f1 and the Nokia 7plus. So my comparision will primarily be with these two.Performance: One word - snappy !Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable.Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone  well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining  yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage  see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case  when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus  instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available.Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple  Google  samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light  low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4  also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads.Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !,One,Brilliant Phone !,5.0

Jugal, 12 February 2020,I have been using Oneplus 7T for a month. I am just providing some general feedback on what I experienced. I'll write both pros and cons for your reference.Pros:1. 90FPS ( you can feel it for sure)2. Fluid AMOLED display3. A pretty good camera (you can compare it with Samsung 10 series)4. Price5. Latest processor6. OS and security updatesCons:1. Battery - With a 90fps display the camera isn't that great. However it will last a day and also gives you an option to choose 60fps to save some battery juice.2. Hugh camera bump - you should avoid this phone if you prefer to use this phone with no case cover3. Slippery (not a con since most of the phones are slippery)You can go for it as this is the 3rd best android device in the market now next to Asus ROG 2 and OnePlus 7T Pro. You will definitely find this phone worth your month for sure.,One,OnePlus 7T - The complete,5.0
TARUNKUMAR, 16 June 2020,I brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020 just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e. shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design build qualityOxygen OS no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.This is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.,One,Overall satisfied 😊 Good buy at 35K even in 2020.,4.0
Sumit Butola, 2 November 2019,This phone comes with a super cool camera which never disappoints with great display and dual speaker.Super smooth performance great gaming experience.Only thing which disappoints a little is battery.It gives a day full of moderate use in one full charge which takes around an hour with Wrap Charge 30T.Ratings out of 10:Camera:9Performance:9Display:10Speakers:8Gaming:9Connectivity:8Charging Speed:9Battery:7Overall User Experience:9,One,Superb performance great camera battery disappoints a bit.Overall value for money,4.0
Vibhor, 21 January 2020,The good: lightning-fast phone. Oxegen OS is brilliant everything you need and no bloatware. The screen is big very clear and ultra-smooth due to the fast refresh rate. Not rated as waterproof but it can take a dunk and keep going. Looks amazing very good build quality. Warp charge is the best fast charging tech out there. 0% to 80% takes about 15minutes.The bad: no wireless charging. Pictures are a bit too crisp making things look a bit surreal. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is not as fast or as accurate as of the dedicated scanners from the last generation. But once that happens the phone is very good and fast. Even wearing a hoodie with sunglasses it will pick me up.Overall I would recommend this phone for people who watch a lot of videos play a lot of games or run multiple apps often. Not for people who take a lot of selfies or care about having the absolute best camera on the market.,0,Top notch phone,5.0
sudhamsh, 12 November 2019,This is my week 3 with this phone. Buy it if you are willing to make many compromises. Some of the basic functions like copy contact to existing contact does not work. Software was given 10/10 in some of the reviews. You can clearly see that is sponsored. Voice is so muffled. Lot of times no clarity or sharpness. Finds it so hard to establish a connection with network. Call drop is so frequent that you will be sure why the networks have become so poor. I had for a short time bought Oppo A83. That phone leaving camera was much better than this phone with its Mediatek processor. Rs.37999 is a complete waste. Horrible Phone !!! Don't fall for the hype by all the reviewers !! You can 2 good phones for the price. Oxygen OS has no Oxygen in it !!,2,bad performance !! Beware of all the hype,2.0
Akash, 10 October 2019,I am a One Plus fan. BUT When I initially bought the One Plus 7T I was appalled by the battery life and the phone heating. I made a complaint to the One Plus customer care. The next day itself I received an update. Since then the phone is not heating up and the battery life has become significantly better. STILL SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT HEREThe finger print reader and the camera could be better but acceptable.Overall I am happy now but not as thrilled as I was with their earlier phones.One plus customer care number is 18001028411The more number of callers the better chance of improvement.,2,Need better battery life....

puneet kathpalia, 11 November 2019,I honestly moved from Oneplus 3T to Oneplus 7T.I don't like other android phones due it's UI love stock android.Camara is awesome especially the macro modeI was expecting great battery but its still its good as compared to 3T amd iphone camerasAs i moved from 3T to 7T I had to buy the type C jack which was a little frustratingComing on to featuresDesign - 4/5+Reduced notch+Premium glass back+Camera bumpPerformance - 5/5+Latest and greatest hardware+Smart optimisationsOS - 4.5/5+Smooth Android experience - Oxygen OSDisplay - 4.5/5+Butter smooth 90 Hz Amoled display - treat to the eyeBattery -4/5+Fastest charging ever seen+Slight less capacityCamera -4/5+Overall good output with all 3 cameras+ Amazing macro mode- Misses details and messes up with Colors sometimesAudio - 4/5+Clear and loud - quality outputCONSNO Headset jack.

Its smooth fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%. am among the first to buy this phone without prime membership.Posting this review after 4 weeks of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good.There is no lagging issue till now.The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first.Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos providedone without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit.Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.Thanks Amazon and OnePlus,0,Super performance phone ..review posted after 20 days of use,5.0

Pankaj Sakhare, 22 October 2019,This phone is what OnePlus is all about.I upgraded to this from a 3 years old oneplus 3T and loving this phone so much.The screen just one word 'WOW' it's excellent at this price point.Battery life gets throgh the day with about 10 to 15 percent juice left. ( over moderate usage)Charging speeds are just unreal it goes full within 45 min max.Speakers are great and loud.Fingerprint sensor is just awesome and pretty fast.Face unlock is quite responsive.Oxygen OS is love.Gaming and performance is just flagship level and on par with any other top phone in the market.Camera is excellent and takes awesome shots.

Nitish Anand, 2 February 2020,Pros+Never before Seen Buttery smooth - Amazing display.Good Camera setup with triple cameras that are actually useful.Great battery life. 6 to 7 hours of screen time.Decently Fast warp ChargingGreat Speakers. Good loudness and also a little bit of bass. Great detail.Build Quality. Amazing. If i could only wish to run it without a case. Feels amazing in the hand.Cons-Charging could have been faster (but it is faster than majority of the phones) considering this takes around 50mins whilst the Realme does it in 30mins and it costs cheaper.Camera bump maybe prone to scratches. Noticed a tiny scratch on the circular lens.No heaphone jack. Cant plug in headphones. And any bluetooth headphones are still ways to catch up to the wired headphones. I miss the headphone jack.A big phone. Difficult but not impossible to maneuver in one hand.Detailed consensus: ~The Display is amazing. Seriously. 90hz. I wasnt as impressed at the beginning as i expected to be. But in month's period ..just looking at my mom's OnePlus 7 screen feels sluggish. Any other conventional display seems outdated and that's where i realised the brilliance of this tech. It just works to provide the best experience without you even noticing. I became really fast at responding with the touch. Gaming didn't work upto 90hz atleast to my experience with pubg but it is great as it is at 60fps. Camera is also good. Wide angle shots are the best when u need to get one giant family in a picture. Portrait shots look like professional dslr shots to post on the social media. Nightscape works decent for this segment. There are some caveats being the white balance which seemes to be inconsistent among the three cameras under harsh lighting conditions (probably can be imporved in software updates). Battery life is excellent IMHO. 6 to 7 hours easily with moderate usage. Even if u game hours on the end you should atleast get around atleast 5 and half hours of screen time. There are however very small but few bugs. The quick launch from fingerprint keeps deselecting the contacts i selected. The gallery seems to have some problem sometimes sending media through whatsapp. There are a few bugs but to my all honesty Apple's IOS right now has a lot more than that. And when it comes to the software this OS is the best fork of android and spending a couple of grand more is justifiably worth it. Once you use it the ingenuity cannot go unnoticed and makes everything simpler. Overall great phone and if you are planning to use it for a long time then you shouldn't have to think twice.,One,An Amazing Phone to get at the discounted price and if you are going to use for a good time.,5.0
Neha T, 16 November 2019,I am writing after using the phone for one month nowwhen i got it due to its weight and no headphone jack i was thinking to return it But after few days i became use to it with the weight which is lesser than one plus pro at least.The screens touch is superb with 90hz and awesome brightness.Camera quality is good and macro mode is very good feature.Colour is also nice but still struggling to get a good and decent cover .In this price it's superb and i was previously using one plus 5 and i am loyal user of one plus.Battery life is not so good and the WARP charging is an add on within 15 mins it's 50 percent .It's a good purchase must buy with this price .Thanks Amazon and Oneplus.,0,Awesome One Plus 7T,5.0
Vishal Raj, 23 November 2019,Oneplus 7tI really don't know how long I'll be enjoying this phone. Because I don't know when they gonna bring it's successor with less price? Better features? Maybe 5 months or 6 months? I don't know why no one is talking about this. Either everyone out there is filthy rich or just out of there mind. Idk. OP need to understand because m sure due to this they really gonna lose there market. Although there is no fault of this phone(OP7t). This phone is best rn in it's league. Go for it.

vibhu, 10 October 2019,The best part of the phone is the gorgeous display. The 90hz refresh rate makes it super smooth. It's a joy to scroll around and open apps. Coming to the camera it's defnitely more versatile then the OnePlus 7 but it's still not great. Battery life is just decent but the fast charging more than makes up for it. Plug in for about 30-45 mins and you are good for the day. Definitely worth the price.The only thing to be wary about is the huge camera bump at the back the outer glass is not scratch resistant as confirmed by the OnePlus customer care executive.,2,Good for the price.,4.0
Gaurav Kumar, 4 March 2020,This is seriously a Flagship Killer Smartphone.I am quite impressed with performance and Quality of this Smartphone.I love the battery optimization and Dash charging technology of this device it saves my lots of time which i spend with my older Samsung devices.In terms of performance i love the performance i never feel any lag in speed while playing high end games on this device.I am not sharing much details here but want to share that i am very much impressed with the performance of this phone after using Other brand devices. I feel this is complete package of Mobile,0,This is seriaouly a Flagship killer Smartphone. BEAST,5.0
elamparuthi natarajan, 1 February 2020,I have bought One plus 7T mobile 3 months before. While I was working in offline suddenly the mobile got switched off and showing that the device got corrupt. I have visited nearby oneplus service center in Coimbatore. They told that the data got erased and need to install the software for further use. But after attempting to install the software the hardware didnt accept the installation. They said to change the motherboard worth Rs.21000/- See the worth of the mobile is Rs.38000/-. What is the use in using this repaired mobile. Very worst experience I faced using the One plus mobile. Dont purchase Oneplus mobile. Very poor technical service in One plus.,2,Dont purchase and use One plus mobile - Files get Corrupt,1.0
Surjit Biswas, 2 October 2019,**Will upload photos soon**Ordered this on 28th September and had it delivered a day ahead today. I'm simply mesmerized to be honest with device's overall performance. Please don't go by the YouTube review about the box and its contents cause on reality you get just the phone packed in its box. No earphones are included in the purchase although it was mentioned in the description while buying it.Pros:1) Stunning camera and it does delivers awesome quality. I'll upload some shots soon. The slow vid and 4k 60fps are two major plus signs. The wide and the ultrawide shots are amazing along with the macro which I'm yet to explore more.2) The screen!! It's super smooth and navigation is simply effortless. The typing response is best I've ever experienced and so is the color balance that you can set as per your preference.3) The weight and build quality is premium and defines the phone as a flagship buster. I ordered the blue one and it's quite an effect on itself.4) Silicone case is included and a thin screen protector film is already applied. The case is not a usual cheap stuff but good one.5) Dolby Atmos. Now I've been using Dolby Atmos for more than 3 years and can tell you that it's a must for people deeply rooted into music.Cons: Device has no cons in terms of looks performance or build quality however I expected a bit louder speaker output. The phone without the cover is quite slippery and can easily fall off so I'm being extra careful with my new baby.Overall this did satisfy my expectations to a great limits considering the fact that I was never an OnePlus guys. This is my first.,0,Great Phone!!,5.0
Dr. Abhimanyu, 5 June 2020,The phone is just perfect. Flagship grade. Minus the headphone jack IP rating and a bit heavy else everything thing is great and it turns out be a great package. Software is bloat free. UI (oxygenOS) is quiet stock like but with its own set of customisation. The colour Glacier Blue looks stunning in the matt finish with its own incorporation of gradient colour shift. Has a big camera bump but is livable with coz it comes with a case that's grips it's firmly. Though the colours are a bit saturated at times but the over all image quality is beautiful well detailed and pleasing. Night mode is another area where it does quit well but not as perfect as other flagships. The fingerprint reader is optical type and is the fastest of its type when compared to other optical ones out there. Face unlock is 2D based but really fast and unlocks in a blink. The battery a big 3800 mah is just great to get you through a day with mild usage but does take a hit while heavy usage such as gaming but non the less it ships with 30 watt Warp Charger that charges it in 50 mins to almost full. Need to mention that it doesn't ship with a headphone nor with a type C to 3.5 mm jack converter which I feel should have been a standard given the premium price one is paying for it.,0,#GlacierBlue : your are gonna fall in love with it,5.0
Jay M, 31 October 2019,I am using one plus since one plus 3 T then 5T 6 6T and now 7T. I found 5T was the best phone. In 7T I purchase recently observed that battry is draining fast. Even if I do not keep net connectivity ON. Camera feature is equivalent to 6T.Recently I got beta version in 6T which is having very good features that 7T. Please think and then only buy.,2,Battery draining too fast.,2.0
Aditya, 21 December 2019,Writing this review after using this device for 6 Months -Pros -1. Super smooth for everyday performance no hiccups anywhere.2. Enough battery life for light to medium usage.3. Very versatile camera setup. You have wide+tele+macro4. Regular updates from Oneplus.5. Oxygen OS has the right mix of stock android and added features.6. Speakers and the display is very good.Cons -1. OnePlus cheaped out on providing a proper cooling solution. This phone doesn't have a Vapour chamber or a  Copper heat pipe. Instead it is using the aluminum frame of the device as a heatsink. What this means to you is that  when you play PUBG/CODM for longer time the phone heats up but from the left side making it very difficult to  hold the device in hand. If you use a case then you won't feel as much heat but you won't get efficient cooling. I  don't recommend this phone for Long sessions of Gaming as this phone lacks in proper cooling solution.2. Battery life is average at best for heavy usage.Edit.3.I got a faulty display that has green and purple tint.,One,Gamers Beware,3.0
somioranjan mekap, 28 November 2019,Have had the phone for a couple of days and I'm still getting used to it. Amazon delivered the phone in a days so Kudos for that. I upgraded from OP5T due to the bargain price on offer but have mixed feelings for phone. Over all its a good phone. Here goes my thoughts on it at length 😀.It feels bigger taller and heavier in hand compared to 5T. Sincerely wish someone starts making flagship phone in smaller form factor again.Have screen guard and a rugged case in the box which is a plus.3.5 mm doesn't come with it so have to order one. I'm not a fan of bluetooth headset as it's one more thing that I have to remind myself to charge.OP launcher is feature rich so I haven't gone back to my Nova prime yet.Tried to backup and restore with OP switch with mixed results.. didn't restore my apps 1st time but asked to restore again while I was midway through reinstalling my apps.Camera is good but will take getting used to. Does not allow choosing the megapixel size explicitly any longer.Overall it has been a step up in terms of specs but have mixed feelings comparing it to my OP5t,One,A good upgrade in line with the current trend but mixed feelings compared to my OP5T,4.0
Kalyan, 24 January 2020,If you are looking for a phone that has great display fast charging great camera and smooth performance OnePlus 7t is the phone to go after.OnePlus has been always offering great at display fast charging and great smooth performance. With the launch of OnePlus 7t they have really improved the camera quality. The triple camera setup certainly helps to capture great photos. Truly impressed with the portraits ultra wide mode and nightscape modes.If you ignore the back camera bump with circular setup this is fantastic phone. Strongly recommend it.,0,True all-rounder,5.0
shashank sharma, 24 April 2020,I am not sure whether Amazon's partnership with SBI YONO is a scam. I have purchased OnePlus 7T from Amazon's API within SBI YONO mobile application.As per the offer I should have got Rs. 2500 cashback as Amazon Pay balance in my account.It has been more than 3 months and I got nothing.Amazon's customer care is blaming SBI YONO and there is no option I have found to reach SBI YONO customer support for shoppingIn my opinion if you are buying something from Amazon then don't belive in cashback offers.Amazon and SBI YONO togather seems like a scam.,2,Amazon's Cashback offers seems like a scam,4.0
Govinda Dasa, 3 October 2019,OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros mids cons and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10 provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series the vibration motor will be 200% strong we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles specks of dust misplacements etc. But this time I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think this they may fix through updates. But however please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display not in CONS but MIDS considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided the device's thickness increases. If not provided no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days to frustrate the old buyers they will release one more beautiful color just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys in the beginning is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated because again in just a few months the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.,0,Excellent: See Pros Mids Cons,5.0
Anshul Agarwal, 3 October 2019,The phone is awsome and is very fast. And is in no way expensive compared to the quality of and the features provided.But I don't like the Colors. And if I am paying 38k for a product I atleast expect some good Colors. Atleast give a basic black option.And I am removing 1 star because of no type C headphones provided with the phone and ofcourse the bad color options. Instead of the ugly phone case provided with the phone I would rather prefer a cheap type C headphones.,2,Great phone bad color options.,4.0

Iam posting this review after one day usage of one plus 7t..Camera is awesomeBattery life is awesomeAmoled display with 90hz refresh ratio is mind blowingOxygen os is just killed...

Amazon Customer, 29 February 2020,I had Oneplus 6 before this and that phone was very good and it made me fan of oneplus. So after using OP6 for 18 months I decided to buy OP7T and it came  but slowly day by day this product is going below my expectations. The only thing I am satisfied in this is Camera. Rest performance is not as expected from Oneplus. The fingerprint does not work that fast. Lags alot and Hangs alot mostly when I get whatsapp calls and phone is locked. Lightroom app works very slowly conpared to my previous OP6. Feel is good battery backup is decent but performance wise am little worried about how long this phone will last.,One,Not as good as Oneplus 6 . Lags  Hangs  fingerprint Response Slow.,3.0
Shalini, 19 January 2020,Reviewing this phone after 3 months of usage.Pros--camera quality is superb-warp charging is a boon for me after full battery gets drained it charges up fully in 30 mins. Can u believe it? It works consistently.-with battery saver turned on battery comes for 2 days with basic usage (calls WhatsApp browsing)-speaker audio quality is goodCons--i couldn't realize how the 90 hz refresh rate improves speed and performance. I couldn't find any difference from an MI phone's.-only USB c port for earphone. So have to buy a Bluetooth earphone or the unreliable c port connectors.-double tap to wake up the screen is not working for me-not for people who handles their phones carelessly/rough handles,One,Worth the price,4.0
Rohit, 23 October 2019,I have to replace my current Pixel phone as it had become too sluggish. I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.PROS- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast- The display is very good- Build is niceCONS- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.Also got it in Diwali offer so the deal was good.,One,Awesome phone in the price range,5.0
siddharth rohra, 2 October 2019,This time one plus has nailed it with more snappier and more smoothing experience mobile ever been manufactured. Using it since a week and it is a breeze to switch between apps. RAM management has improved drastically than before. Camera is decent but provides you with the better quality than other 48 mp equipped phones currently available. Gaming mode is the best as I play alot of games most heaviest of all till now is cod mobile which runs buttery smooth and gives you pc like graphics and frames.Best buy and recommended for gamers.,2,The best buy of all,5.0
Satyam, 6 October 2019,Battery charging is really fast..But again u have only 3800 mah battery.Sound quality is far way better .There was much hype about camera and i bought the phone due to that purpose only and sadly it doesnot come par expectation.Black blue surface and camera looks nice and different.Navigation tools are working fine.You will feel the void of 3.5mm jack.,2,Not worth the expectation as per price also but good phone,4.0
Pankaj619, 14 October 2019,I bought OnePluse first time and i am very happy with its performance camara quality and other things the only problem is battery life it drains very fast if i am playing games or watching the video it's it gose 100 to 40 % in just 2.5 hrs .  If i am using it only music and chating it gose 100 to 50 in abut 5-6 hrs with out any heavy use. I compared battery like with OnePluse 6t at 90%  6t was giving 21hrs of life and my OnePluse 7t was giving 13 hrs of life.About face unlock system i thik there is some problem with it . Even by brother can open my phone and we are not twins. Other then that it's the one of the best phone i ever used.,2,Best phone if they removed battery issue.,4.0
Ankit Arora, 28 December 2019,Sold the phone in within 10 days of usage bcos of some unacceptable issues1 The vibration of this phone is too light that you can't feel that into your pocket when someone calls you2 The main reason of selling this phone is that when you're on the call and the third person calls you bt u can't get notified that  the third person is calling you while at that time my call waiting was also activated..Besides these two reasons phone is decently good at this price point as it can't compete with Samsung bcos Samsung's screen quality the speaker quality is way better than oneplus..,One,Please let me knw if more users face this same issue.,3.0

Sunny Verma, 18 March 2020,I am using this product from last 5 months now. A good upgrade from my previous one 3T. I will list down the pros and cons for your better understanding.Pros-1. CHARGING- the fast 30W charger is absolutely amazing. Charges the phone from 0 to 100 just inside an hour. 30 mins charge enough to give power for d entire day.2. PERFORMANCE- 8GB RAM + 855+ Snapdragon is a lethal combination 🔥 fluid & perfect in every sense. Never faced any lagginess in day to day use.3. DISPLAY- the fluid AMOLED 90Hz display is outstanding. Gives hard times going back to 60Hz displays.4. STERIO SPEAKER- the dual Dolby Atmos speakers are louder clearer & better than ever. The music comes out equivalent to that of mid ranged bluetooth speakers. The bass is also fantastic.5. CAMERA- the triple camera set up for 48+12+16mp does the job amazing. The best part is macro shots.6. OS- OnePlus's biggest strength is its Oxygen OS. Better than stock android in all sense.Cons-1. NO 3.5mm Headphone Jack2. 3800mAh battery is just average. Will give you backup whole day if you use moderately.3. The phone is fragile because of its glass back and needs to be kept in a protective case 24*74. My phone had an issue initially while rebooting which was however gone after an update.My final conclusion- GO FOR IT!! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.,One,Simply outstanding!! Typical OnePlus,5.0
Vignesh, 20 October 2019,Camera qualityWorst camera quality.couldnt even match with Redmi phones.total 40k is a waste.Wgem zoomed the pixels are.appearing dotted.I didn't expect this even after doing the update for camera.I mainly bought this mobile for camera clarity only.But it is worser compared to the previous versions.A mistake done.Finger print is very good.Screen sensitivity is very good.Slowmo effect is good.Super macro is good.,3,Worst camera in OnePlus series,1.0
Ali, 5 October 2019,I know many of you are complaining and many are comparing it with different phones like ROG iPhone.Talking about the ROG 2 - Its a great gaming phone having a long lasting battery with good charging.But if you are purchasing a phone for its :*LOOKS*CAMERA*SCREEN*FAST BLAZING CHARGING*VALUE FOR MONEY*UI*ANDROID 10.I am sure you are missing nothing at all here.It is actually a great purchase on its own at 36K .. ..The iPhone 11 stands no where nearer to it if we compare the overall features of both.The iPhone camera is amazing.But is it worth Paying - 25000/- more for just a camera having LCD Screen & a small 60HZ display.You can end up buying another phone or two at 25K for sure.The Camera quality The Display Fast Charging are One plus key features.,0,Beast At its Best !!,5.0
Shubham Goyal, 6 May 2020,Both Sims stopped detecting within a week.The back cover had a tiny line that expanded into a big crack.Amazon has not been very helpful.

Balraj lakshatty, 13 October 2019,If you have one plus 6 or 7 do not upgraded to this there are no major changes in any form camera or anything. Before this I had one plus 6 recently I lost that phone so bought this one and Im not found  any major difference. Wide angle and that macro shot in camera are excellent where as in normal mode the color production is very poor when we compare to old OnePlus series  all photos comes as very whities.

vikas, 4 October 2019,Using it since last one month.. product quality is not upto the mark its hang a lot some time its camera freezed and feel helpless OS is superb... blue colour look very good. Battery life is average will long last till 10-12 hours only with screen time of about 4 hrs  without gaming but its charge very fast.. screen showing pink tint when u see it from side. Camera is good. Got Warp 30 adaptor in the box instead of warp 30T but as per Amazon its Warp 30T technology is in the phone hence charger is warp 30 only. Phone some time stuck which is surpise to me may be some software update will resolve the issue. Placement of volume button is not correct as accendently it captures the screenshots. Seems its bit overpriced and should be priced at about 32K with better battery life. If you are comparing it with Note 9 than will advise to go for Note 9.,One,Not a great performance with low battery life,3.0
Mikul, 4 October 2019,I've been planning to switch from iPhone to OnePlus phones for long and the launch of new OnePlus 7T seemed like the perfect opportunity.

Be it unlocking the phone in a snap or accessibility of using productivity or social media apps or running heavy games like Fortnite and Call of Duty - this phone is a beast. I would highly recommend everyone to go for it especially Apple users who are planning to switch,One,More than just a phone,5.0

M. C. Bhavsar, 7 October 2019,Oneplus phones is no doubt one of the best available in the market but when we compare with the latest Asus ROG phone - 2 OP 7T seems a bit lacking in terms of the 90 Hz refresh rate headphone jack USB- C port. WARP charge is the best available right now in the market but battery drains rapidly. It seems price is little bit more compared to when Oneplus started. Battery draining very fast Hope Oneplus will fix it.,One,Oneplus keep getting better but competition is hard. Battery issues,3.0

Sanchita, 23 May 2020,This is the best phone ever. Period. The smoothness is uncanny!!! I have been using the OnePlus 7T (128 GB Glacier blue) from the last 4 months and have to say it is a wonderful experience. Apps run smoothly the camera (specially the super macro mode) is amazing. The charging is better than I ever imagined. 40 mins in the morning and I'm good to go for the rest of the day!The fingerprint and face unlock works great.

Vijay Paidipalli, 24 January 2020,Fingerprint scanner opens well but sometimes looks confused in terms of transition effect to open the home screen it gives a glimpse of the pin  screen (open with pin) and then vanishes and lands on the home screen. the photo quality can definitely improve in terms of the depth sensors (doesnt look like the grey sensors dont measure the depth properly)Otherwise a Great looking product with good UI (and am liking the gesture controls on the Latest Android version).I have heard a lot of complaints on the battery performance. Its only 2 days and it lasted me more than 24 hrs on a single charge.,0,very premium looking product. can make improvements,4.0
Amazon Customer, 11 December 2019,One plus is going to be one of the most recommended phone in android but there are many points it’s disappointing1. Camera is good but not outstanding i dnt know why but i never impress with the picture quality2. Design worst design ever like they have just copied nokia lumia serise3. Battry could be higher.4. Could offer atleast 2.5 jack connector at this price,One,This product is only for one plus lover disappointed,3.0
Rajeev, 11 October 2019,I am writing this review after using this mobile for more than a month. The battery is extreamly poor need charging two times in a day. Phone gets heated in long call just like any cheap chinesse phone. The phone speed is just like any other phone in the range of 10-15k. GPS is inaccurate. The camera is good but far lower than what you get in an i phone. Overall dissatisfied with the product. Looks like i bought an average product at high price.In the last one plus should now change their solgan to full compromise. Since their phone is a full compry phone.,2,Very poor phone wrongly marketed as premium,1.0
A.vamsi Krishna, 2 October 2019,Display is so gloriousSuper fast charging - It takes one hour from 0 to 100 thanks to warp charge 30TAbout 90HZ display - atleast I can't see the difference between 60HZ and 90HZSuperb cameras.Oxygen OS is very smooth and fast.Battery last for one full day - even if you play gamesAfter all this is 1+7T. Go for it.,3,East or West 1+ is the best.,5.0
Partha Ghosh, 5 October 2019,The delivery was late. I received the product 7 days after the order was placed.Pros:-1. It is buttery smooth and fast. Thanks to Oxygen.2. The network reception is fantastic. It does not fluctuate much during journeys.3. The Display is fantastic and no complaints.4  I am not a gaming buff so no comments about gaming.5. Charging is very fast which compensates the smaller battery capacity.Cons 1.I felt that One Plus should have provided a good quality cover and not the plastic one that is now provided.2.The camera could have been better and one plus has to go a long way to catch up Samsung and Iphone in this regard.3.Battery performs on an average note and one plus should look into it in future.Otherwise it is a fantastic phone! It is smooth to the word! Just loving it!,0,Very good,5.0
avi04, 17 October 2019,Review after ine week of usuage:-Design: The design is gorgeous with glacier blue colour having a gradient finish on the back. The camera module is somewhat a personal prefercence but in 2019 with all phones looking exactly same from back side it does give it a different look. Personally i really like the camera island type design.Screen: The screen is full hd amoled 90hz refresh rate screen. Its again gorgesous to look atmedia content looks amazingand once u start using 90hz refresh rate its dificult to go back to normal 60hz refresh rate. Its something which can be experience d and cant be explained.Camera : The triple camera set up does the job the main sensor is 48mp sensor which takes great shots in daylight/natural light ultrawide lens is great for taking wider view and is a superb addition to main camera. Portrait shots have good depth and does a good job at separating object with the background. The best feature has to be the macro modeit takes some great macro shots with subject as close as two inches all the food bloggers will love this feature .Performance: Fast performance is just fast u throw anything at it it just doesnt lag multitasking is butter smooth.Battery : battery is decent gets almost one full day around 15-17hrs at heavy usuage. But charging is super fastplug in and u get 0-70 in almost half hour.Over all at this price point this phone has top notch specsand delivers the performace thats expected out of it.Only Asus Rog phone 2 is near and in some cases better than this phone at this oricebut dats a game centric phone and may be not everyones cup of tea.Last words: If u are in market for a new oneunder 40k price bracket and want all the flagship features great performace and software experience and all round performibg camera...Do go for this phone !!!!,0,A major upgrade !!!!,5.0
Ellen Maumkel, 6 October 2019,A beautiful phone.,6,A work of art!,5.0
Nilesh, 16 October 2019,Very powerful and great display.Camera is typical OnePlus where they tend to do some overprocessing especially colour reproduction and edge sharpness. Edges of any object are not sharp slight oil paint effect and oversaturated colours in bright light. Software update should fix it. Portrait mode gives a very great blurred background.Battery life is good with moderate use you can get through one full day. Switch off the 90Hz and you are comfortable for the day.Adaptive brightness is flawed right now but it will be fixed by bug fix i am assuming.Oxygen OS as always is great. Dolby Atmos sound is great.Very few things to point at and many things pointing out!!Only complaint no frosted silver in 256 gb,0,Great phone - Flagship performance at Competitive price,5.0
Nitish Agrawal, 4 November 2019,"OnePlus was my dream since OnePlus 5 and finally i purchased OnePlus 7T. Believe me it's great. You will never regret buying this as it's super fast with great capable cameras and Stereo speakers are fantastic. I would recommend you to go for frosted silver as the company is also promoting Glacier blue more and that's why everyone is taking blue but Frosted silver is far far better. Blue  looks like funky but you a decent colour then go for Silver and Black Sandstone OnePlus Protective cases looks great with frosted silver guys. Trust me.2 more things...There are many negative reviews regarding Amazon so before purchasing i myself contacted customer care and they assured me that in case of any problem..my phone will be replaced. But i didn't faced any problem. Just check the box if it is sealed otherwise ask a replacement.Many people are facing an issue including me  of "" Turn on the wifi to finish the setup""Today i got rod of this by simply turning on the wifi closing the mobile data and then.. clicking on start and following the procedures. Don't go for deleting the cache memory and all.",0,Great Phone but only Frosted Silver🙃,5.0
ABHINABA LAYEK, 4 June 2020,Camera quality is terrific.. actually this is a multy working device..you can do anything with that like high gamings high softwarebrowsing..etc.... Little bit heating issues while you playing game with connect charger..and yes..there is a one problem it has no 3.5 mm jack facility..so you need a ctype cable to convert it 3.5 mm jack headphones options..one plus team should think about it.. Thanks..,2,Just Awesome..,5.0
Ajay Tomar, 12 January 2020,I'm more of a laptop person but wanted a good phone and i think i got it. This review is after usage of 15 days.So this one's going to be in different points:1.) Display: 90 Hz is really good if you spend a lot of your time in your phone. If you keep on 90 Hz you will get even less than average battery life. I recommend turning on 90 Hz only when you are doing something which needs great display quality.2.) Battery: It's the only con i could find in this great phone. BUTBUTBUT the charger makes up around 90% of this less battery life issue. You can get full charge from 0 in at max 70 minutes. To summarize you can go for it if you have a desk job.3.) Performance: It's pretty fast. As fast as any reasonable person would need. Truth is this is a 35k phone so the performance you get is definitely worth 50k. Don't compare it with phones which are above 80k or 90k. If you do that you're just a badgering person.4.) Camera: Not really a camera freak but it's really good. You get all the details you want and expect from a cell phone. IF YOU ARE A SELF-CERTIFIED CAMERA ENTHUSIAST BUY A DSLR. Nobody's stopping you from that. Don't hope a phone will give you the world's best camera.I wish i could give 4.5 stars but since Amazon only supports a Floor Function or a Ceiling Function when it comes to rating could only give a 4.,One,Only issue may be the battery life other than that go for it!!!,4.0
Anish, 24 February 2020,This phone is like aThis is not the most premium phone on the market. Its not as good to hold as an iphone 11 or have the fantastic camera like the Samsung flagships. What it is though is the snappiest no-nonsense phone on the market.Oxygen OS contributes a lot to this. Everthing on the phone is lightning quick and snappy. Apps open instantly and the phone responds to everything you do like its nothing.The 90hz display will spoil you and every other phone display thats not 90hz will look like ageing technology.Battery life is okay.. In most cases it will last the entire day with medium use. That's hardly a problem though because 30 mins will give you full charge. The dash charging is something I cannot let go off which is why I refuse to buy more premium flagships.The triple camera and the camera software in general is not in line with what premium brands like samsung and apple offer Oneplus isn't doing anything new here. The macro feature is however worth mentioning.If you are having trouble deciding if this phone is for you let me break it down :1. Camera & Photos is priority - Get Samsung/Apple instead2. Speed is priority - Get OnePlus3. Fast charging is priority - Get OnePlus4. Budget is a concern - Get OnePlus5. Color accuracy is a priority - Get Samsung6. Apple EcoSystem is a concern - Get Iphone,0,Bang Bang for Buck,4.0
Sivaprakash, 2 October 2019,This is my first highest budget phone..Ordered oneplus7T within 15min when they started to sell it.90HZ smooth display really works well.Camera quality is awesome.Gaming performance is also good.Dolby atoms is also great the clarity of sound is very gud.Finger print unlocking speed is gud.Snapdragon 855plus is one of best in this phone.You can't feel heat when you are using for more than 1hr.Warp 30T charge is quick 100% charge in 30MinFingerprint is too fastCamera clarity is awesomeGood battery backup phone,2,Awesome mobile with gud specs,5.0

Amazon Customer, 1 July 2020,Let me tell you guys it going to be one week till the date when I received .....It was great experience while opening the box make feel me a premium one I took the mobile in my hand.So being honest guys I really loved it only I have few things against this phone :1) Screen size is too big for me but it's depends on your choices.2) The audio jack which can be ignored by you.Cons:Amazing camera guys...Night mode is above than expectation.Battery life is good.Touch and display it's superbDue to good processor it's make very handy while using.Lot of options in theme.Gaming : I was playing COD and trust me guys it was like a cherry on cake.If you have budget guys for 8 ..I would prefer for it but 7t is also a beast.,One,Overall it's superb guys....!,4.0

ShaMeeR, 8 May 2020,I was not a great fan of one plus over the past years and changed my view when i first saw photos shot and edited by my friend who has the one plus 6t. I was instantly in love with this brand. From that day onwards i started plans for buying one.Finally i bought 7t when it first launched in amazon.Amazing phone with beautiful camera setup. screen has great clarity and colour reproduction  It enhances movie watching experience and gaming. Decent sound with dolby atmos. Its more than enough.  Past years i used samsung devices. I was about to buy redmi to go cheaper but i made a brave decision.Want great specs? Reliable ? Camera centric and power device with screen and sound. Then this is it!,One,Best Smartphone i owned so far!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 29 October 2019,1. Fingerprint reader is fastest in the market.2. Excellent OS. Great optimization.3. Back Camera is really good.. Bt some times photos came over saturated. Clearly Selfie camera needs improvement.4. 90Hz screen is classy crisp and bright. That is a different experience you have to try it to understand. On the other hand for 90Hz display battery gets affected.5. For moderate users Battery life is good for 1day usage(Over 6hrs screen on time).. But need one dedicated update for battery improvement. 30T wrap charger charges fron 20% to 100%  in 45mins.Verdict:Need software updates for:1. Selfie camera photo quality2. Battery improvement3. Problem of Back Camera over saturated photosThis phone is absolutely a great buy in this price segment.Oneplus surely looks for betterment. If oneplus will solve those issues this phone will be close to a perfect phone almost.,One,Almost there 1+T,5.0
Devilsoul09, 6 June 2020,This phone is really good too good screen and super build quality feels really good in hand just little disappointed with battery life  it can be coz of 90hz refresh rates in screen but if you keep it on 60hz your phone battery will long last  but chargeing speed is too good so nothing to worry about. Go for it,One,Best budget friendly Flagship phone,4.0
Riyas Muhammed, 9 October 2019,"There is an issue were reported by my side. Which is ""screen not responding"" to my touch. Actually i have made a chat with one plus india team as they have advised me to return/ replace the product.1.Actually the phone now OK2.At that time after updating the latest version of OS(After 1 hr) the phone goes hung and the screen doesn't respond to my touch dont know what is the actual issue still now.3.But the physical switches like power button volume silent mode and even face lock and finger print sensors are worked smoothly. Only the screen were not responds. I cant able to restart the phone also.4.Then the one plus india team advised to remove the screen card  and i test it but no luck.5.Then advised to press power button + volume down button (Factory data reset) till 20- 30 sec but no responding.6.Finally i decide to go for replacement at that time i realize  there is no replacement as becoz its out of stock(Not sure the reason).7.For a last chance i just press Power button+ Volume up button god grace its restarted at the time and the issue cleared. But not sure which is due to the OS updation and all and don't know whether issue came again or not.***Now the Phone is working Smoothly*** Only purchased on 09th OCt 2019.

Bhaskar Biswas, 6 June 2020,This is my first purchase from a costly phone range after using 10k budget phones.After a several months of use i found no issue until a month My phone wasn hang on bootlogo suddenly after usual battery drainage gone to service center found no help rather than factory data reset and erase everything they say but I disagree to give my phone to them that day as I had some imp data in there so I took my phone back home and after charging it to full then I don't know how it came back to life again then after that this problem was never happened again.About this phone I think this phone is way costly as its camera it not that top notch quality Click good pictures under good source of light but night vision is good like okish portrait is also good but only from back cam setup(48 mp)Battery life is good when you use you don't use your phone that much otherwise ok until you gaming or using highly loading websites specially when you play PUBG the battery drains down quickly here. So this is a major drawback.When it comes about processing speed and visuals (90hz) it gives all its best.So if you want to buy it for faster multitasking or gaming its a good choice but if you want to buy this phone for battery backup camera quality you can find something better than this,One,Honest review after several months of use,5.0
Rohith V., 18 May 2020,Am not against Oneplus 7t or Amazon. I love Amazon. And I was going tonuse Oneplus for the first time.I ordered it twice and got the damagedd phone. First the phone was not even booting and second after the welcome details its not detecting wifi or not even mobile network..completely fedup..am not sure whats the actual problm?

ARCHISMAN DAS, 18 June 2020,I have purchased OnePlus 7T on Amazon. The packaging was really nice. The first look of the phone after unboxing just impressed me.. It was vright metal finished. Glossy.. Super smooth..  Booted the device. It's just Awesome. Super fast. Brilliant touch screen. Full Amoled Display. Battery life is very very nice.. Support fast charging. Charge from 10 to 100 percent within 30 mins approx. So the overall experience is awesome. Thanks a lot OnePlus for such an amazing device. I recommend it to everyone who want to buy mobile within 40k.. Use it. Enjoy it..,0,Just Awesome,5.0
SHASHWAT ANAND, 2 October 2019,A great product by OP in the line. Amazing Camera and processor. Super fast warp charge (actually charges 0 to 70 percent in 30 mins). Sound is great on stereo speakers. Cam quality is the best at this price range.,4,The best you can get for 37k,5.0
Saji Varghese, 7 October 2019,Ordered it on 28th and got it after one week on Oct 5th  i think as a prime member it was much late.If am telling about the phone its simply superb and first over OP phone .... previously i was using Le2 and used for 3.5 yrs.Mostly i loved in 7t are its build ... very handy and easy to hold with one hand so many gestures it is supporting one is in the screen off mode if am writing O in screen i can light the flashlight... like these we can give 4-5 gestures.Cameras are superb  a super macro camera is highlight and also the portrait one.Good speed and have a good battery backup of one full day after a moderate use  without playing any game and in 60Hz.Very speed charging as they said within 30min 70%.Till now no negatives i have found  another thing is they are giving a good transparent cover.,One,Mindful,5.0
Akash, 21 April 2020,At this cost many of my friends suggested me to swith to 🍎 but really op 7T is really something.Faster but sometimes is screen get frozen while playing pubg and many times app's get automatically restart but never got any problem in video editing or video playbackGood camera but round shape glass camera get scratches while not on plane surface..At 60Hz fps the battry can run upto 8 to 9 hrs while continue but at 90Hz it's about 4 to 4.75 hr in my case and the most frustrating part is it doesn't have a jack...But a good product 👌,One,Upset with battery and sometimes chrome 🤧,5.0
Nanak Hotwani, 17 December 2019,I wish i had other options. but unfortunately all these made in china phones are similar be it Oppo Vivi Mi Realme Xiome etc etc. Motorola was a good brand but since Lenovo took it over it's quality has deteriorated.There is no headphone jack. you have to buy separately a C2 adopter and a headphone or go for wireless head phones.If you can afford then go for Apple (Though it is made in China but it is much better).,One,Not Value for Money,3.0
Danish Zargar, 2 January 2020,I have been using OnePlus devices since the launch of 3T and my entire experience has been seamless. OnePlus 7T is no exception as it easily surpasses a lot of other devices at the same price point and even gives a touch competition to some of the flagship phones out there including Samsung and Apple. The Ram management large screen in-display fingerprint scanner camera and all other features need no mention as OnePlus has always focussed on delivering better. Should buy if you have a budget in that range.,0,Flagship in Budget,5.0
Amazon Customer, 22 April 2020,My cell is switching  on and off on its own randomly. Once it switches off it goes into a continuous reboot mode. (Like a loop). I NEED to wait  till the battery  drains out for me to  actually  do something. I have no over choice. I have video proof  of the same. My cell is hardly 6 months old. Between January to June this has happened 6 times. I even contacted the One Plus service center who did a remote flash. Useless. The problem still persists. I was never expecting this from Amazon and One Plus.,2,Cell not working.,1.0
Venkat, 8 December 2019,The most concerning thing about this phone is the battery life.  The battery life could have been better comparing the rivels.  The worst flagship phones that had weaker battery performance have resolved this issue but I wonder why OnePlus did not see it as a concern. I have bought this 7T after having used Redmi Note 4 for 2 years; I have had premium smartphones in the past such as iPhone 3Gs 4 Samsung Note 3.I am totally happy with the performance with the only cons being an average battery life.  Redmi's battery was overwhelmingly good with a decent performance.I am using battery saver option during work so that I have enough juice left till I reach home. The Warp charger is a saviour.  With battery saver option I am able to sail through the day to bedtime.The call quality speaker and signal reception are good even at basements and underground metro stations.Oxygen OS is close to stock android and snappy most of the time.  Additionally OnePlus is offering free extended warranty for 1 year for all its customers having models from OnePlus 6 onwards which is a great marketing strategy.,One,Value for money except for the battery life,4.0
Abhishek Nair, 25 November 2019,After a month of use these are the pros and cons I've had with the Oneplus 7T.PROS:-Insane charging speed.-90Hz ingenuity.-Blazing fast performance.-Bright screen.-Amazing macro mode shots.-Very fast face unlock.CONS (after one month use):-Though it is fast in charging there are variations. The charging time during 85% of the cycles from 0-100 is around 50-55 minutes but at times it has taken me nearly 1 hour 10 minutes.-Though not regularly it does heat up at times when there is heavy usage.-The phone feels heavy considering it only has a 3800 mAh battery.-The camera is great but may not seems impressive because by default the regular 'Photo' mode only produces 12 MP pics. And to make use of the 48 MP you have regularly use the 'Pro' mode.-The haptics seem mediocre as the double tap to wake up/turn off the screen is noy always responsive.-1080p display. Though this may not be a dealbreaker for everyone you gotta admit that watching videos or playing games on a better screen is just beautiful.-The auto brightness is not on the dot. It doesn't always detect properly. And when it does it's too slow.-Not having wireless charging in 2019 🙄. Come on Oneplus!Apart from all of this it still is an amazing phone to use and definitely recommendable to other. This is the technology world and nothing is perfect. Cheers ✌️,One,Oneplus 7T. A month later...,4.0
VMG, 8 October 2019,"Honest review after use of 1 week.Pros -Camera in daylight is amazing. Supermacro shots are wonderful and crisp. Inbuilt AI works smooth and detects the scenes in quite good manner.Telephoto wide angle and portrait altogether compiles very good camera setup.Front Camera is similar to what we have in one plus 7.Processing is smooth like butter no lags whatsoever. Have got about 90 apps apart from the bloated one's. Opened  worked performs very well.Gaming is brilliantalso the new haptic feedback adds cheery on the cake for gaming.Sound quality is superb both the speakers are tuned and doesnt make any noise or irritation kinda even when it is full. 360' sound effect feels amazing.Display is very very crispclear and Bright. Everything is perfect. Even though its not above 1080p  but never fails.Battery - Complete 1 day backup for 100% charge. And if 1 or 2 hours goes less WARP charging is always there.Cons -No headphone Jack.The nightscape is waste it seems. Sometimes its giving patches on the subject making it feel like its painted or something. Not good at all. Hope One plus provides updates on regular intervals for improving this.Fingerprint reader is not much fast compared to the other devices however face unlock works perfectly fine. Expecting fingerprint reader will improve in future updates.Bundling everything in one word - ""Beast"" altogether.Go for it.

SANKALP MISHRA, 6 December 2019,1.Everything is good in this phone except their is no audio jack for earphone/headphone which is all right if you use wireless headsets.2.This phone is Beast itself as it come with snapdragon 855+ processor  8 Gb ram  in this price range we are getting good phone. So it can run any android game on max. setting available. PUGB-m runs on HDR graphics with EXTREME FPS.3.Camera is really awesome you can take micro shots also. slow motion video supports upto 240 FPS .4.Face unlock works properly even in low light but fingerprint sensor is little bit slow (FOR ME BECAUSE as i am switched from physical sensor to optical sensor.)5.Battery life is not good as it discharge faster than other phone also it discharge even when it is not in use but charging is Super-Fast (WARP 30 T CHARGER).6.OXYGEN UI is good as it provides many utilities and gesture for faster commutation  but as  i am switched from MIUI so i don't like it too much but in oxygen UI their is no bloatware as compared to MIUI.7.So in the end it is premium looking flagship with beast specification.,One,After All A Good Smartphone To Buy.,5.0
Shreya Dutta, 18 June 2020,OnePlus 7T is good phone that supports the use of various applications together. I use multiple applications simultaneously and I haven't faced an issue with that. I'm in love with the sensitivity of the fingerprint sensor. The camera is really good and that has helped me work on my photography and editing skills. The sound system works great and the display adjustment is quite good. I have an issue with the battery because it drains really fast. So make sure you keep the battery saver on all the time for longer use. Another issue with this phone is that it does not come with a Type C to 3.5 mm jack as mentioned in the description. I had to purchase it separately as the description turned out to be misleading. Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the phone.,0,Great Premium Phone but Battery Needs Improvement,4.0
Jeff Mathew, 11 October 2019,The experience with the OnePlus 7T is simply smooth and flawless. OnePlus have realised the difference a 90Hz panel makes which is why they are including it on all their products. And you have to use it to believe it a screen with 90Hz refresh rate is truly a joy to use (undoubtedly my favourite part of the phone). Coming to battery life it easily lasts a day and a half for my usage but my usage is not that heavy. I only have to plug it in for 40 mins every morning before I go to work nothing else ( charging speeds are INSANE). Lastly as a person who is coming from a phone that was in a much lower price segment I find the cameras to be more than adequate. However if you truly want that top of the line camera experience you may have to look at other flagships. We also know how quick and reliable OnePlus are with software updates and that is yet another great positive with this device. All in all for 38K I feel like OnePlus hit the nail on the head with this one. The phone is so slick and a joy to use on a day to day basis and comes with more or less all the bells and whistles you need.P.S: OnePlus is now offering 2 years warranty for models released including and after the 6T. So I guess that's peace of mind assured as well!,One,Seamless and Flawless 90Hz Goodness,5.0
Amit Ojha, 21 January 2020,I have received the package with all the security and pin number and parcel code as though it was delivered by the IB. Then realized that people have been sent soap and marbles in such packaging in the past that Amazon had to secure it from the middlemen who sneak it through.The 7T is a powerhouse and yet it saves a lot of power to push you through the day. All in all the phone is excellent with a lot of tinkering options available for you to play with this handful of tech marble(not marvel). But the irony is not lost on the fact that I have clicked the attached pics with one of the better camera phones (Honor 8 pro) for the review. Will update with the pics clicked by 7T soon. Thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery and Thanks OP for maintaining the quality and challenging the status quo.Never Settle OP.,0,A VFM product that goes beyond,5.0
Venkateswara Raju, 13 January 2020,Being a big Fan of One plus this disappointed me alot when i changed it with One plus 5T to 7T.  The performance wise i doesnt feel much difference despite of having upgraded OS. Camera is way much better due to change in lens. The most disappointed thing in this phone is battery. I have to charge it minimum two times for a use of least 14 to 15 hours. Atleast they have to upgrade the software to be feasible with 3800 Mah battery. Looks are good having a circular lens on the side.,One,Think before going for it,3.0

Keyur, 20 February 2020,"I ordered this phone on day 1 because I wanted to experience ""flagship"". Got this for 40k. So am using this phone for 4+ months.The first time I got hands on this phone it didn't feel very classy. One shouldn't pay more than 23-25k for such a phone.Pros and cons mixed just as I think:1) Screen flickers! Irritatingly so. Certain games such as ""push 'em all"" is not supported as screen begins flickering. YouTube also causes screen to flicker most of the time. Not everyone may be able to notice it but it does flicker you can search videos about it on YoutTube.2) OxygenOS has bugs with in-app Twitter browser with its own Notes app and many others. I reported all within 2 days of buying the phone but forget fix I didn't get a response either. These bugs were very irritating at first now I've somehow gotten used to those.3) Camera is better than most android phones I've seen but Pixel and iPhone 11 beat this one hands down.4) Battery is average lasts 24 hr. Good thing is the dash-charger - It's very impressive charges in 60-65 mins from 0 to 100% and 0 to 70% in ~30 mins.5) Night mode Reading mode are also impressive and I feel the difference when compared to other Android phones.6) Finger-print reader could have been better7) Face unlock doesn't work in dark or even dim light. Even in lightness our face needs to be in proper angle and a lazy face doesn't help unlock.8) You need to buy a usb to 3.5mm jack cable separately.9) Flash could have been better.10) 8 GB RAM can be felt. It's fast. WiFi Calling app installing holding a network - all are very good.11) Video calling in dim light/darkness could have been better. Way better.12) Speakers are great. Ideal for music.13) The gestures part is good. Makes a lot of functions easier and classier.14) Haptic vibration is awesome.15) I like how it asks for permission for everything and gives plenty of options regarding access to apps and carrier.16) I use Glacier Blue and love that colour.My lower rating is mostly because of OxygenOS bugs that I mentioned above and flickering. Also within a month of launch they reduced prices drastically. So if you can deal with these cons and high price go for it. Else buy K20 for lower budget and iPhone 11 for higher budget. Happy shopping!",One,Buggy OxygenOS flickering screen average camera average battery high price,2.0
Syed shakir, 3 October 2019,Hi After using Oneplus 3for a long time I upgraded to 7t finally..The oneplus 7t purchase was with lot of expectation and it's a brand I Totally have Faith as my oneplus 3 is working absolutely flawless even now.Ripley's believe it or not my Brand new oneplus 7t with Android 10 kept crashing time and again from the very first day.. I am feeling disastrous and getting blamed by my spouse (iphone user) who suggestdd me to go for iPhone XR (available at 37K bow in offer) . Keeping fingers crossed for any update by oneplus and save my belief in the brand.Other Pros:- Solid body Touchscreen is very responsive  camera is superb but not as good as iPhone 11 series 3d sound amazing.Cons:- Keeps crashing while using camera and apps New UI needs lot of tweaks. Deserved an earphone in package triple camera position is elevated and chances of scratches increased,One,Oneplus 7t is not Flawless lke it's other siblings,4.0
Samir Mall, 29 June 2020,Buyers beware caveat emptor: Amazon is selling these phone through its sellers like Darshita electronics. The product sold was already registered on OnePlus care months before the actual date of sale thereby reducing device warranty and also devoiding the customer of options to purchase accidental protection plan from OnePlus. Going by the OnePlus record it is possible that the device they are seeking are resold devices.Amazon does not take any responsibility of loss of warranty (though the warranty is advertised on its platform). They will not even replace your device in the above case. Instead they will ask you to bring certificate from OnePlus denying service (so the buyer has to go through the trouble of going to oneplus) and good luck trying to get a denial of service certificate from OnePlus and then going back and forth on the issue with Amazon and oneplus. Remember you will probably not be able to use your phone nor get it repaired during all the while not to mention the waste of time and effort educating their customer service executives who will keep dishing out standard replies.And you still will not be able to buy accidental protection plan. I needed the same as these so called water or splash resistant devices (don't go by YouTube videos) did not survive under water even under normal tap water pressure (OnePlus 6) and standard warranty does not cover liquid damage even for ip68 rated instruments.It is advisable to buy directly from the retail outlets. Register the device there itself for warranty or accidental protection and get the device replaced immediately at the retailer in case of any issue. Remember that the prices are same.,One,Buyers beware,1.0

Amazon Customer, 15 January 2020,Believe me dont go with the hype if you are really concerned about performance with security this phone is surely not meant for you. This is for young generation only who just want to click pictures not for professionals. Face Recognition is worse most apps dont work the way they should most apps crashes there is nothing like encryption. Please take this into notice before purchase else you will regret.  This phone is not an alternate to iPhones and Samsung Flagships it is not even near to that.,2,Please dont go with hype,1.0
Rahul, 7 December 2019,OnePlus started it's series as the flagship/Nexus killer with the OnePlus Oneand now it has become the flagship. Except few hiccups like OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X OnePlus has had a good run. OnePlus 7T is just another addition to its good phone list.This review is after almost two months of usage so will cover mostly all that people actually care about as a general user.1. Design is a very subjective opinion and depends on a person's taste. Personally I'm not a fan of the circular camera but won't rate it as bad. However the back panel is quite slippery and a fingerprint magnet so would suggest to go with a case.2. Display on 7T has followed the upgrade of OnePlus 7 Pro. 90 Hz is quite smooth but it isn't something which general users will care for in the long run. I still prefer the 1080p panel over 2K. The higher screen resolutions are just battery drainers and don't add quite much to the experience in my opinion. The screen is quite slim and tall which makes the phone a bit bigger for use. The waterdrop notch doesnt ruin the experience as such.3. Battery life wasn't upto the mark when I first received the phone and gave me mere 4-4.5 hours SOT which was quite disappointing from a newly purchased phone. However the situation changed after I visited the service center and they reinstalled the OS to what came with the phone i.e. 10.0.4 and after which I updated it to 10.0.6. Since then battery has been really great. I have been getting 7+ hours of SOT on normal usage and around 6 hours with one hour of PUBG. After this tweak the 30T warp charge does look like a bonus. I believe the 10.0.5 update which we received after getting the phone was somehow the culprit behind the battery drain.4. Camera has given me some mixed results. Not bad but not great either. Previously on my OnePlus 6T the Gcam was doing a great job but since we haven't received a perfect Gcam for 7T yet the stock camera is the better option to go and it clicks quite decent photos.5. Android: Before switching to OnePlus device I was a Nexus user and I was quite used to the stock android experience. OnePlus provides just that with few extra tweaks which doesn't ruin the stock experience. They provide quite regular updates on their Oxygen OS which is quite commendable.Overall OnePlus 7T is quite a great phone and can be recommended except that it'll get old in just six months. If you are looking for a new phone and this phone is on your mind then you should go for it.There is one problem with the WiFi which I have noticed is that Wifi faces drops when connected to 5 ghz on some routers. It works perfectly fine on 2.4 ghz channel though.,One,OnePlus 7T: The almost perfect phone for ₹35000,5.0
Ketan, 25 December 2019,Display- 90hz is smooth- decent 1080p OLED- visible outdoors- rating 4.8/5.Design- pretty slim and sexy- small notch on display almost bazless flat design.- ugly camera bump ( i hate it )- rating 4/5Performance- SOS 855 plus with 8 GB ram its really smooth as u expect- plus that 90 hz screen really helps to smooth things out.- rating 5/5 ( duh)OS- clean android OS with some additional features which are really helpful and will stay away if u dont wanna use them.- i personally think that oneplus does andriod better than google without its 1000$ price tag.- freq updates- rating 5/5Camera- exellent day light photos ( on par with best of 1000$ flagships)- night mode is also great ( i will say 70% compared to best out there.)- good dyanmic range contrast colors- videos are also good at 4k 60 fps.- macro mode is way more fun- rating 4/5Battery Life- i am a light to med user and it lasts me whole day with 30-40 % left. ( 90 hz all the time )- warp charging is insanely fast 0-75% in 30 mins.- compared to my OP 3 its better even at 90hz all the time.- rating 4.5/5final wordsits an awesome phone if u want the notch less display then go for 7 pro which costs lil bit more than 7t.but oneplus did it again bang for bucks.,0,FLAGSHIP FROM ONEPLUS ( review after 1 month of use),5.0
Riya P, 12 June 2020,The above photos are shot on the OnePlus 7t. I got this phone yesterday. I was really excited and looking forward to the phone. But all my happiness was dampened when I turned on the phone for the first time. The phone went into an infinite boot loop in the first time itself. It went on for few hours even after charging fully. I was really saddened and couldn't find much help on the net. Fortunately my cousin found out some site I tried the solution which was factory data reset and then it worked! The phone booted up normally. Since then it has been functioning smoothly. As I understand this issue occured due to some issues with Android 10 and OnePlus and it may not happen to everyone. Don't get me wrong the phone is great and definitely value for money and stands by what the reviewers have said. But as this problem happened to me I would like to bring it to the notice of the manufacturer and people through this review. Definitely a great buy but be vary of this boot loop issue. Best features of this phone are display camera and storage. Don't think much before buying this it won't disappoint you and will certainly surprise you in good ways. Coming from someone who has been using Android phones since the past 10 years.,One,Must buy awesome phone but be careful of one issue,4.0
Shrinidhi A M, 16 February 2020,Best things1) The space is massive upto 128 GB so really need not worry about the space2) Frankly this is my second One Plus my earlier one is One Plus 6T which is blazing fast got this it's much more blazing fast.3) You may think the features & options of One Plus 7T & Redmi Note 8 Pro are similar but trust the facts One Plus 7T is leagues ahead of Redmi or any iPhone or any phone.4) The options and way of working is really really fast compared to any other phone.5) Most importantly it's all about regular updates and timely fixes. The One Plus community is pretty strong here.6) It's worth your money worth in the show of it;  Rest is all in detailsBest thing about 1+They ensure regular updates !!,0,Go for it !

Sivarama Krishnan M, 27 May 2020,I bought the mobile in the first sale on September 30 2020. Reviewing it after 8 months.Pro's:1. Solid performance.2. Great 90Hz Super AMOLED fluid display. It feels very smooth throughout the UI.3. Fast charging capabilities and good battery life. Easily lasts a day in heavy usage.Con's:1. Camera's are good. But not great for the price we are paying for. Front camera is not even usable in some night shots.2. Lag of IP certification.3. Feels a bit heavy while using in one hand.4. Huge camera bump.5.

Amazon Customer, 3 June 2020,The camera is very good but there were some changes in the colours while shifting lenses . Battery life is good it can easily last u upto a day . Face unlock is amazing. but the finger print scanner is not so effective. The display is awesome. Oxygen Os is a bliss . The 90 hertz display makes my experience ultra smooth . Gaming on op7t is so good . U can play pubg on the highest settings,2,Amazing phone,5.0
Himanshu, 9 November 2019,This was my 1st 1plus phone and honestly i didnt like it a bit. Yes oxygen os is good but the phone itself is average for the price. I have rog phone 2.

Ashish, 8 December 2019,I had heard a lot about OnePlus phones so finally thought of buying 1. Before this I was using Samsung S8 which never hanged in 2.5 years though the processor had become a slower over the time.But this new OnePlus phone has already hanged multiple times.Camera quality is nowhere near the premium phones. Leave the premium phones apart Oppo provides better camera phones in 10K. The phone is also very heavy.OnePlus is fooling the buyers with new marketing techniques. Looks like it pays to the famous gadget reviewers to over hype its products. Its performance is like any other chinese phone. Display colors are also not upto the mark.Now they have also started dropping the prices. If anybody wants to spend this much money on android phone he or she should go for Samsung or Google Pixel phones,One,Disappointed,2.0
Amazon Customer, 27 October 2019,This is great leap in tech from my old OnePlus 6. I just fell in love with my 7T from day 1.Oxygen UI on Android 10 coupled with a powerful hardware has just made my day. The haptic feedbacks are amazing and the dual speakers just bring life to the media you steam on the fabulous display. Camera is a treat to watch macro mode just kills it!!Peace of Advice: Put some decent protection to 7T with good hardcases to keep the all glass body safe.

Hatichua, 8 October 2019,Am not a OnePlus fanboy infact this is my first OP. After 3days of usage this is what i think about this.Pros: 1-Design and build quality- the phone looks good feels good in hand. Build quality is pretty solid. I feel the blue one looks better but that s subjective.2- Display- it is just gorgeous. The screen brightness is nothing like I have seen before. The 90 hz refresh rate is simply awesome.3- camera- the only two phones that I feel have better camera than this are S10 plus (also note 10) and the 11pro. There are few features in this that even those phones do not offer. Considering that this is almost half the price I would consider this a win for OP.4- Oxygen OS- my last device was an Android one phone so I was used to the stock Android experience. Oxygen OS takes the same experience and kicks it up a notch. It's just so smooth and provided some awesome customization.5- Charging speed- This has to be one of the fastest charging phone out there. Goes from 0 to 50 in about 20 mins.Cons- 1- no notification LED. 2- Haptics could be better.3- Display should have been quad hd at this price point.4- stupid notch. 5- A type C to 3.5 mm adapter should have been provided in the box. 5- Could use a bigger battery. 6- The always on display only works when you lift up or tap the phone,One,Unbiased review of OnePlus 7t with pros and cons,4.0

Anish, 9 June 2020,My package was delivered by Amazon Shipments. The Amazon delivery executive was very ill-mannered and that could be very costly during this pandemic. He didn't even wear a mask or maintain social distancing and I request Amazon to ensure that their employees keep their standards.I had initially planned to get an OP8. But since the stocks ran out quite fast in the flash sale I chose to go for the OP7T. The 7T is pretty much all good for my personal needs and if I am to be a bit pragmatic you don't really need a OnePlus 8 unless you really want that IP68 rating 5G tech and the newest chipset.The 7T is pretty good and checks most boxes for me. It's fit for casual photography and gaming and also has a 'one-whole-day' battery life even with my heavy usage. The fingerprint reader is much better than my previous 6T and camera quality is alright. The phone is pretty much very water-resistant but really an official rating would've been a lot better.,One,Phone is alright Amazon's delivery is not.,4.0
Abhi, 4 November 2019,I'm a regular oneplus user since OP1 my journey with oneplus was like OP1>OP5>OP7T the phone is great display is butter smooth thanks to 90hzs refresh rate camera is great with right settings video recording is superb the OIS does commendable job battery life could be issue if you always use at 90hzs multitasking is great overall a great value for money.,One,Just one word AWESOME..!!!,5.0
navaneeth, 1 April 2020,Got this phone March 5 as promised by amazon appreciate the package and service delivery. Phone meets expectations in terms of performance and camera (with Gcam).Pros: 30 Watt warp charge is super fast in terms of charging.Triple camera setup is superb for day light as well as for night photography ( did install Gcam 7.3 for night & astrophotography)Display is super smooth and touch screen is fingerprint sensor is fastCons: Battery life could be improved eats up lot of battery at 90Hz had to lower it to 60Hz to improve the battery performance. Phone lasts for one full day with medium to low usage.Keyboard: Looks like there is some known issue with android 10 switches out of application while typing in whatsapp.None other I can think off.,One,Value for money device,4.0
KiranM, 5 November 2019,I switched from iPhone 8 Plus and here are my opinionDesign:Design could've been better looks midrange doesnt look premium.Display:I was excited for 90Hz display which feels faster still feeling like a gimmick. Resolution seems below average images doesn't look that sharp they look mediocre however brightness is really good indoors outdoors in sunlight kinda hard to see.7T Display is too narrow and feels like a tv remote to be honest and kinda feels weird for a phone. OP7 Display is long wide and nice.Camera:I miss the images iPhone produces with natural colours. OP 7T camera is very midrange and not flagship level images are yellowish indoors portrait is below average and yellowish. Outdoor pictures are really good. I take lot of pictures and camera turns out to be a big disappointment for a flagship phone in 2019. Images looks like taken from a 15k phone than the 40k phone.Oxygen OS and Android 10:Oxygen OS is minimal and feels nice to use. Android 10 feels buggy i experienced few lags freezing had to restart the phone at times which im not happy about.  Whatsapp and Instagram is not updated for Android 10 and has issues when trying to attach image images in gallery looks tilted and blurry i called OP tech support they said its problem with 3rd party apps and not the device. So waiting for an update...Audio experience:Via Speakers or through earphones doesn't sound High Definition like iPhone sound so this is a bit of a downer for me.Overall Experience:Phone is nice to use however i had high expectations considering the reputation of OnePlus phone turns out to be a mid range device for a premium price. I would say SKIP this please.....,0,Midrange Phone for a premium price tag....I would say avoid this...,4.0
Parag Karnad, 22 December 2019,It's been a month since I am using this phone and i have to say the performance is just incredible. The camera is highlighting point which performs extremely well especially for MACRO shots and portrait. The 48MP sensor is good. The Oxygen OS is pretty close to stock android. No customizations like custom skin. Thanks Amazon,One,A true beast,5.0
Navjit Singh, 22 June 2020,Here are some of the things I noticed.RAM: Well the device is good but I think there is an issue with the RAM optimization. I was using it just for a day and found out that out of 8 GB only 19% of the RAM was left to use. Even though the phone didn't get slow at anytime. At first I thought it was due to the RAM boost thing they do with these oneplus phones but even after I turned RAM boost off and restarted the phone about 67% of RAM was available to use. Are these numbers normal? Idk.Internal memory: Even though it says 256 GB of memory the system takes up around 30 GB of memory. Like what the hell.Sound: Stereo speakers' sound is a charm to listen. The dolby atmos works even without the headphones. But you need content to take advantage of it.UI: The UI is too basic to my liking. I like Samsung's OneUI. But I think that's a personal thing.Fingerprint reader: I think it's the fastest in the industry. I mean I was using Samsung A50 and its fingerprint sensor barely even works. There is no comparison between the two but I'm just saying.Product Verification: idk where to verify if my unit is original since I haven't bought it from OnePlus site.P.S. This is my first OnePlus device and it looks good so far.,0,I think there is an issue with the RAM,4.0
santhosh, 2 October 2019,Overall Quality and performance of phone is really good. But the design of back camera should have been more efficient.And one plus should rethink of not providing earphones at this price range.,4,Great phone but design could have been better,4.0
Sk Murshed Alam, 27 May 2020,I have no qualms against the features which are provided. Overall it is a very good phone for the price you are paying. But one thing which they could have worked upon is battery life. I don't play games and all but I am on my phone a lot. The screen on time I get is around 5-6 hours. For me it needs a full charge and a half charge to survive a day. But the warp charger is there.,2,Good for avg user. Not so good for heavy user,4.0
Dinesh Kannnan, 11 November 2019,Device looks and feels awesome in hand. Nice build quality. 90Hz refresh rate display is smooth. Rear camera module isn't that awkward as mentioned by many since we hardly see it. Camera performance is good though color difference is noticable when shifting between 3 cameras. There are few software glitches and bugs seen which are being fixed by updates. Still needs few updates to make the device bug free. Major down point is battery life which is not that great for continuous media consumption or gaming that too with 90Hz setting. But Warp charge comes as a savior. Delivery took its sweet time of 10 days which was a bummer.,One,90Hz of awesomeness,4.0
sanchit, 13 October 2019,You don't need 7t pro or 7 pro. Jsut buy 7t and save money plus no fragile curve screen. Buy 128 varient which was at the time of sale people got in 36k which a good price for such a package. Display camera smoothness every thing is great.I am going to write about cons because there are a lot of merit and few demeritCons :- battery backup telephoto lens colour production a bit heavy and tall camera need few ota updates to produce natural image but it will get improve over timeThings can be improved - make it a bit small like 6.3 should have 3.5mm if not at least bundle a dongle telephoto should have ois just like pro varient can be a bit cheap if the phone was small in size,One,Best T varient till now,5.0
Amazon Customer, 18 October 2019,Battery is the only fear that i expect will be low but thanks to power management it is gently goes approx 22-23 hrs easily with normal working like 3-4 hrs youtube internet full day location on and more over calling more than 3 hrs in a day what i use daily. Very sufficient for me as unexpected from this 3800 mah battery only.Moreover camera quality is just mind blowing specially front camera and rear portrait mode and nightscape mode is awesome and also macro mode is just fantastic one...beat every segment of flagship....not its time to screen....so its like butter in ur hand....just one word to explain this mini moster is 'AWESOME'. My first oneplus phone it is and i just Love Oneplus.,One,Screen like Butter and camera features like DSLR,5.0

Amazon Customer, 20 October 2019,I have been using this phone for over 2 weeks now and I thoroughly enjoying it. It is buttery smooth in all functions. I am not a gamer but Boy! playing games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty is a treat on this phone. No heating issues at all. Charging speed is superfast. The phone went from 13% to 98% in just 40 mins. Oxygen OS  as always is great to use. Cameras are also great this time specially the inclusion of wide angle camera although I wish it would have been a little wider. And I miss OIS on telephoto lens! That would have made the phone complete. The speakers are loud and clear so no complaints there. Overall I feel this is the best option under 40k for a flagship level experience specially for it's software 90 Hz screen and great performance. Beats every other Chinese brands for me who are trying to impress everyone with all the specs but no juice inside!,One,Worth every single penny!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 6 December 2019,For a layman this phone is an absolute waste. My criteria for buying the phone were- A good charge holding through a day-Ease of taking photos-Ease of usage of messaging and other appsThe phone heats ups at the slightest of use and the I keep getting alerts that the phone temperature has been stabilisedThe charge of the phone will barely last you until noon with maybe about 10 callsbackground apps keep running even if you dont need. The ease of getting around the settings is cumbersome.If you open a video on whatsapp it dissappears into the back and only audio will keep playing. so embarassing when a call comes inYou cant silence the ring when the background video is playingAbsolutely unwieldy and dissapointingwilling to give away this phone to anyone who can pay me Rs.20000,One,7T phone not worth the hype,1.0
ramjm2002, 17 October 2019,I have been a loyal customer of OnePlus bought with great expectations but disappointed with the product. My OnePlus 5T experience was better in almost all the areas.

In just few days i started hating this Phone and within a week the price from 39999 went down to 37999 with some discounts and nobody is willing to buy a hardly used Phone for even 33-34k. Regretting buying this OnePlus Crap.,2,If you are a iOS User Do not go for this crap. You will Hate Android Devices more.,1.0
Sudipta Paria, 15 October 2019,Fingerprint Reader and Face Unlock both are quite fast and works perfectly mostly.Camera is very good at the price point comparable to OnePlus 7 Pro but there is still scope of improvements.Battery life is good and lasts a full day for medium usage.The screen is really nice and cool with 90Hz refresh rate and looks brighter than other AMOLED display phones in that price range.However there are some important omissions like lack of notification lights Always On display feature Low performance from front camera in low light etc.The pricing seems not reasonable since the competition is much higher now and most of the features are available at lower price range.To conclude Impressive effort from OnePlus Significant upgrade but costs more than the expectation.P.S. - The main plus of this phone is Oxygen OS and given hardware chipset 855+ SoC which makes the phone blazing fast.,One,Fits perfectly between OP7 and 7Pro but pricing could be more reasonable,4.0
SUDIPT S, 25 November 2019,Being a One Plus Two user since 2015..and was amazed by the overall built quality of the Phone ..and still after 4 yrs..my One Plus Two are pretty good but had to change it...So 7T-256gb was the best option I could find out of the all available options...And it was love at 1st Sight.....Have been using for a month.....And u can complain nothing for this phone...And out of all...The camera options are fantastic....  are every thing is just fine...Only the fingerprint sensor is tag slower than what I feel it would have...but the face unlock is awesome....At this price brand...I would recommend none other.....,One,The best phone within 40k..,5.0
Sainath Badam, 3 October 2019,Starting of with the performance it's powered by 8gb ram 90 hz and the latest Qualcomm 855+ - this combo made it butterly smooth !One of the best cameras in the segment no flaws found as of now.No heating issues battery drains a bit faster on 90hz but thats okay.Warpt charger has you covered.Great job one plus !Con :Missing led lightandroid 10 os issues (minor),2,Beauty and the beast !,5.0
Prasad Thorgule, 20 October 2019,For given price the phone is no more a flagship killer bjt has become a flagship phone to be killled by competition.The phone is well built camera quality is decent the screen is a good Oxygen OS is one of the best in Android OS.The price is on very higher side the phone doesnt has anything thats spectacular which may demand such a premium. The competition is offering same or better at low price point.If you want a OS with no bloat  and consider Oneplus brand to be good than you can buy one but the phone is no more a value for money.If you care for value for money settle elsewhere.,One,Not a flagship killer anymore!,4.0
Ateet Ravalji, 3 October 2019,Just got it delivered today for the wifey. The phone looks awesome. It looks like it was designed with love and care Initial impressions beautiful stunning display camera looks great android 10 and oxygen os feels fluid refined and minimalistic. The refresh rate does make transitions and animations smoother. Macro photos look breathtaking. Unlocking via face or fingerprint is fast and hassle free. The premium glass finish back feels just right. Going to test the charging now.,2,Stunning phone. Go for it!,5.0
Raj Lamba, 12 December 2019,Overall this is a good product of one plus except Bluetooth connection problem with the any music device like speakers car music system and Bluetooth/Wireless earphone/headphone. This is the biggest problem with this product that the company has not provided space for wired headphones and we have only option of wireless products but the Bluetooth connection remains disconnected frequently and we have to light/on the phone or have to reconnect. One + provided software update for the same but the problem is still hanging and we are facing problems even after spent a big amount on so called flagship phone. Nowadays you can't enjoy your phone/device without Bluetooth connection working improperly. The second problem with the device is it awake automatically even in your pocket even after on the pocket feature and start opening apps wrong passwords attempts and sometime start music which is very embarrassing when you in meeting or public place. if 1+ cure these problems by software update then device is awesome otherwise not even good in this high price.,One,GOOD PRODUCT WITH SOME CONS,3.0
Ray, 10 November 2019,Here's my personal take on the new OnePlus 7T - Most of the reviews here is positive and yes it's probably a decent phone but unfortunately it didn't work out for me.I had couple of major problems with this - Overheating and battery discharge. I have been with the OnePlus ecosystem since their 3 model. The last one I had was 5. And it's very very hard to beat that edition. Probably I had higher expectations from 7T. The phone overheats while you're on a video call. It shoots up to 48-50 degrees and simultaneously discharges faster than Samsung. I have reduced the refresh rate removed the animations live wallpaper - still it's very mediocre.Just comparing with my OnePlus 5 it didn't feel like an update that's worth. The camera was never OnePlus's strong point and it remains with 7t. It's average at its best.The phone's generic performance is fluid as expected but the flaws above didn't make the cut. I have returned mine and decided to go with something else.Cheers to those who liked this phone.,One,OnePlus 7t - an honest take!,2.0
Dhananjay Pardeshi, 3 October 2019,Inside the box:-You only get the handset and the charger and a transparent case you won't don't get any headphones.Pros:-1) The one thing that attracted me to buy this phone is its Screen. Believe me it's the best part of this phone. You can clearly feel the difference between a 60hz display and a 90hz display. The amoled panel reproduces amazing colors and it also gets decently bright.2) Duel Speakers this has 2 speakers. One in the bottom of the phone and one in the earpeice. I think this has Dolby Atoms as well. You ll have a really good experience when it comes to audio.3) The phone is really smooth and works like butter thanks to its 90hz Screen and top end specs switching between the apps scrolling feels really fast.4) Cameras - the cameras on this are pretty decent and the front facing camera is not a pop up one so no moving parts. The notch is small.5) Super fast charging - phone comes with the fast charger inside the box and it's crazy fast to charge the phone. It's faster than OnePlus 5.6) The Screen - ohhh the screen.. viewing content on this screen is mind blowing.. its the best part of this phone.Cons:-1) Size of the phone when it comes to the dimensions of the phone I think it gets really tricky to handle this phone while typing or vertical use. Its a bit heavy as well. The phone is a bit thick as well as compared to Oneplus 5 my privious phone which was the perfect size and weight.2) I think the battery backup could have been better. The screen eats up the battery. I was not using my phone that intensively and still the battery drained faster as compared to my previous phone. (Fast charging helps though)3) No headphone jack - well this was going to be the deal breaker for me in buying this phone but I went for it. This phone doesn't have a headphone jack and also OnePlus doesn't even provide the type C to 3.5mm adapter out of the box.. will have to buy it separately or use bluetooth headphones which will again have a toll on the battery life.4) The big camera bump on the back. Yes it's too big and if you don't use a backcover you phone will always be uneven on the surface. It looks not that great too.5) And one thing that I noticed is that this phone comes with a pre applied screen guard but the plastic doesn't cover the whole screen area so when I had the back gestures enabled from the right bottom corner my finger used to scrach on that screen guard which was very unpleasant and I was worried that constant scratching might loosen the screen guard and it would peel off or something so I had to disable those gestures and use the on Screen buttons to navigate.6) I dont know if its the software issue or the camera itself but the picture quality of the cameras is not that great or what I was hoping for.All in all.  This is a good phone for the price that it comes.,One,Worth It...😍,5.0

Ismail Rishan, 12 November 2019,READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASING!!!ONEPLUS 7T - COMES WITH TELEPHOTIC LENS AND 90HZ DISPLAY AND 30WT WARP CHARGE!!!ONEPLUS 7 - DOESN'T COME WITH TELEPHOTIC LENS AND 90 HZ DISPLAYONEPLUS 7 PRO - COMES WITH TELEPHOTIC LENS AND POP US SELIFE CAMERA AND CURVED DISPLAYNow ask yourself what's your preference and what's your budgetIf you want to click good portrait pictures then just go for OnePlus 7t ( it has 12 MP -2X TELEPHOTIC lens )If you want to phone with fast performance then OnePlus 7 should do the work but remember it doesn't have TELEPHOTIC lens and the portrait pictures will come average and not DSLR Type pictures as it doesn't have TELEPHOTIC lens!If you want curved display and pop up SELIFE and also good portrait pictures ( 8 MP telephotic lens with 3x zoom) and also you have the budget buy OnePlus 7 pro.I'm coming from iOS and I must agree OnePlus is a serious flagship brand and I love the oxygen OSAs I'm a huge fan of stock Android I would agree that Oxygen OS is better than stock AndroidComing to the phone .. I'll sum it up in one word Phone is a BEAST!!It's worth every penny spent on this phoneIt'll easily last the whole day and oh man 90 hz dispaly is just super smooth and just amazingAnd coming to the camera the actual reason why I bought this phone was for that telephotic lens and I must say portraits do come out really good and will get better with updates and yes one thing I miss out from my old iPhone is the selfies. Selfie is average on this phone but don't get me wrong it's great but can't match up with iPhone selfies but yes portrait pictures can be compared with iPhone portraits but hey I was not willing to pay so much just for a portrait from an iPhone that's why ended up buying this beautiful OnePlus 7t and I don't regret it at all as I have saved a lot of money and most probably I'll buy a dslr or just use it for my travel and explore new places.Guys just close your eyes and purchase this device. It's worth the price ! And don't Oxygen OS IS THE BEST!,One,Phone is a BEAST!!,5.0
venkat, 5 January 2020,Overall i going to give 1 star after one month using i give only 1star ...this mobile like oppo mobile A5 series.. Spend 40k is waste of money ...it is going every time full heat...update any app in Google apps...and normal use in pockets also....getting fear some times in pockets.....it going too heat like cheap mobiles.. i recommend not to spend on this mobile...back side glass is very delicate...even it slips in meter high it was broken...,2,Waste of money low quality of back panel,1.0
Shravan, 18 October 2019,I have been using OnePlus 7T for the past week and based on my hands on experience I would say that this is undoubtedly the best smartphone under 40k. According to me the best past of OP 7T is the charging capability it has and I must say I have never seen somthing like this. The phone runs roughly 10-12 hours on one charge and for some it's a bummer but with 30 min. of charge you get ~70% battery which in my opinion is superb.Some are saying its camera is not up to the mark but in my opinion it is superb moreover one must not forget that its camera is compared with iPhone 11(which is industries benchmark for camera comapison). Even if it doesn't exeed in comparison with iPhone 11's camera it is still way better than other companies camera in that price range.All in all I would recommend OnePlus 7T without any doubt.,One,Battery beast,5.0
Chandan K., 31 October 2019,The phone is really superb but I am really disappointed with ONEPLUS for not optimizing the software and fixing the bugs. Sometimes the Ambient Display is working and sometimes not even after restarting and trying several methods it is not working but suddenly it will work from the next day or after some time. Then again it will stop working (like it is playing hide and seek).Also sometimes the phone heats while playing games for a few minutes but at a times it doesn't heat even playing continuously for some hours.EXCEPT THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT,One,ONEPLUS just fix the Bugs,4.0
sankar, 28 November 2019,Great Device with minor issues.1. Fingerprint unlock feel slow sometimes.2. Oxygen OS is the best UI after Pixel's Stock UI but they are few bugs that as tobe fixed.3. 48MP camera takes good photos with some contrast (look OK) and ultra wide telephoto also good. Need some software improvement for daylight photography.4. Nightsight 2.0 is worst photos comes very smooth. In 7T and 7T pro we can take Nightsight photos form ultra wide camera too that's very bad quality... Nightsight also need more software improvement.Good things about this device.1. Display feel so good it as 1080p 90hz.2. Android 10 gestures are very smooth with 90hz display.3. Performance is good.4. Battery life is good for me.

Purnachandra Rao, 19 March 2020,I am using this phone for a month now. Honestly it didn't meet my expectations keeping in mind the price. Below are my observations.Battery life is not great. For average usage it lasts only for about 12 to 25 hoursCamera quality is good though I was expecting front flash.One fundamental issue I observed is with selfie. Even average phones will negate the mirror image of text but it is not done by this high end phoneGPS quality is not good. I got jumbled maps with my fitness appCharger is very goodSome of the functions which are default in my previous phone (moto g5 S Plus) are not available in this phone.,0,Good phone but ...,4.0

Abdul Raheem, 26 December 2019,"1. As the Notification LED is not available in OnePlus 7T it is very difficult to understand the Battery charge is full or not do we have any new message in the inbox etc.2. Each time we need to touch the phone to know these things.3. The notification for may of the APPs like Azan IMO calls etc. are not working properly due to some advance level of battery saving.

Sumit Kumar, 8 June 2020,It's been two days I got my one plus 7t mobile. Pls find my observation below1. Camera quality superb both back and front - 5/52. Performance is more than expected - 5/53. Fingerprint reader is good but not so quick as it should be. It's taking more time - 4/54. Battery is under Power. As per the costing it is not justifying the capacity of only 3800mah It's not that much good it should be atleast 4300mah. Needed to charge twice for medium use - 3/55. Display is super. Can be visible in outdoor condition I.e. high sun light - 5/56. Phone has overheated in starting but now no issues. May be due to the first start up processes and upgrades. I have done all the things like installation and upgrades in the same time. After restarting it is working fine phone temperature is in between 30-38°C So as per my understanding no overheating issues7. No frame lagging if playing any HD games.8. Dash charger is super. Charging mobile just in 60 minutes.,0,Super phone and totally happy with the performance,4.0
Shrey, 26 June 2020,I love everything about this phone except the fact that it is chinese. The camera quality is top class it has 4k 60 fps recording that is vey good. The macro mode and the zoom mode is top class. It's processor is just amazing I can run pubg at HDR extreme fps. Although it may have some heating issues but no problem it is fixable you just need to update it's software. I also like One Plus's Red Cable Club. When you make a One Plus Account then join the red cable club from the seetings and you will have 6 months of extended warranty that means whatever the warranty was given with the phone 6 months will be added.,One,Best phone for this price range.,5.0
Nafisa Mohit, 8 June 2020,Bought a gift for my brother the phone the package and the presentation was excellent.Pro - Camera output is the best! Great processor output! Seamless gaming and streaming experience! 90Hz refresh rate is Magic to eyes and the feel of the Engine Haptic Feedback is unbelievable.Con - Battery is small for a large screen and such high processor. OP should have atleast dished out 4500/5000 mah power to make the phone last a day or more with such high specs.Was planning to buy ASUS rog 2 however the final selection with OP7T is worth every penny.

Sunil, 12 March 2020, My review of this phone is after using for 6mnts.I just bought this mobile because of its popularity . Now i realised it is not worth of 40k .The price is so high coz of their market startegy and they dont have their own manufacturing industry in India.I say this phone is worth of 28k.ProsBuild looks premium.Fingerprint and face unlock is fasterIts handy only if ur palms are big.Performance is fine when compare to oppo or vivo(only slight difference not much)Video or photo clarity are good only on good lighting conditionConsCamera bump it irritates.Camera quality is not good at night even with night mode. Lots of distortion and photos are polished.Many times i have observed phone getting hanging on and to get back normal i have to restart.Also once i have seen whatsapp audio was running background even after killing the app.,One,Not worthy,2.0
Amazon Customer, 28 October 2019,I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S8 for the last 2 years and switched to the OnePlus 7t 256 GB a couple of weeks ago. My feedback based on the 2 weeks of rigorous use vis-à-vis the Galaxy S8 –Pros:- Amazing 30w Warp Charge is the fastest I have seen. My rigorous use means I need a big battery and being a Samsung loyalist had considered the M30s. However the sub par specs other than that massive battery on the M30s meant I went for the 7t and I am happy that I chose this.- The finger print sensor is much better than the Samsung S8 and the haptics are also quite good. Overall the cell phone also feels faster than the S8 in day to day usage and the data access is also visibly faster.- One grouse I always had with the S8 was that the speaker loudness whether on a phone call or listening to the single speaker was terrible for a flagship phone. By comparison the stereo speakers of the 7t are brilliant. I actually have to turn down the speakers listening to YouTube videos it is that loud.- The box comes with the fantastic warp charger and surprise surprise a basic transparent case. I purchased a more robust case as I am prone to dropping my phones but it is a nice gesture by OnePlus. The idiots should probably have included a USB C to 3.5mm jack as well but then there’s no end to asking for freebies.Cons:- The biggest negative is the screen quality. I don’t mind the 1080p resolution as I also ran my S8 in 1080p to save battery. The problem is that the 7t screen never feels vibrant like the S8 despite adjustments. The back lighting is inconsistent and feels patchy. And for some reason the Auto backlight adjustment seems to always set up the screen darker than it should. In summary nothing comes close to a Samsung AMOLED.- Another aspect of the screen that bugs me is that the oleo phobic coating on the screen or rather the pre applied screen guard is terrible. The screen always looks dirty as compared the superb black mirror look of my Samsung S8.- The reason I almost didn’t purchase the 7t was that it offers no SD Card support. I did opt for the larger 256 GB variant but I would still prefer the choice of putting in my own micros SD. I also don’t like the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack but that doesn’t affect me much.  I have shifted to the Jabra 65t Elite BT headphones for everyday work. I use a Dragonfly Red DAC with OneMore Quad Drivers for music listening on flights.- Using the phone over a 40 minutes drive with Android Auto I found the phone heating up. Samsung S8 never had this issue because Samsung is extra cautious about heat management after the exploding Notes episode.So far so good with the OnePlus 7t. It is superb value as compared to the Samsung S10 range. The S10e that has specs at par with the S8 of nearly 3 years ago is a rip off at 50k+ and the other S10 phones are daylight robbery of even greater magnitudes.Simply put I take my phone selection very seriously and frankly there seems to be no phone that can offer better value and user experience at this price range.,0,Superb phone superb value. Get It!,5.0
Aaditya Singh, 27 October 2019,OnePlus 7T:I rarely change mobile phones only when and if it is required. My average mobile lasts me 3-5 years before I change one.I opted to go for 7T this time. My review for past one week is :Design- I believe this is purely based on personal preference. For me I really like the overall design and color. It does not feel cheap and has premium feel to it.Display: The is display is a gem and feast to the eyes while at 90hz. The games work smoothly and the touch response is really good.  My eyes do not feel strained and you also get the option to change it to 60hz to save battery. If coming from a layman's perspective you will even enjoy the 60hz display just because the display is Crystal clear.-DC Dimmimg is addition feature which the OnePlus has added to avoid screen flicker at low brightness and some of the users have been still facing the issue. From my personal experience I did not face any of such issues and the feature worked flawlessly. I believe this is more of certain product issue and this is something which OnePlus needs to address. If they don't mean to settle just like their OnePlus 7 range then they need to address this issue.Camera: Camera works flawlessly. However Some people liked the camera bump on 7T and some didn't. Personally I don't mind till the time it serves it's purpose. Just need to take a bit care of it. You will enjoy clicking pictures from this camera. The macro lens provides a very good perspective while clicking the pictures. Although I feel the camera does make the pictures a little warmer. The nightscape mode provides a clear pictures at night. However I think it could have been better. The pictures could also have been a little more sharper.Overall pretty good camera.UI: It works flawlessly with regular updates. Yes I already got one within a week of owning it. Nothing more to say here.Fingerprint reader: One of the fastest scanner I have come across with multiple animated options to choose from.Overall- 4/5I'm enjoying using this phone and I have been appreciating the thought process gone though everything while making this device to provide such a beast.-No heating issue. Fnatic mode Gaming mode works efficiently. All the games including COD PUBG Asphalt Temple Run work brilliantly at Max settings.***Also you get the back cover and screen protector with it. If there is any update on regards to the over all functioning of the device then I will make sure to update it over here.,0,The OnePlus that we deserved:,5.0
Subhajit Sarkar, 6 December 2019,Propably the best smartphone under 40k. It has all that features of  flagship phones have right now. Starting with super fluid amoled display with 90  Herz refresh rate fingerprint reader to face unlock   everything is so perfect in this phone. Also battery life is very  with 90-100% battery it can barely last for one day and half which is at par for every descent user out there. Now coming to the most important segment i.e. camera OnePlus is not known for its camera qualities bt for the first time they have really worked hard to put up all the flagship level camera qualities in this one. If you are looking for good camera  better battery life smooth display experience and Oxygen OS. It is the best t version of OnePlus among all the other previous phones. All this qualities make it a must buy.,One,First time OnePlus user experience,5.0
Robin Singh, 28 October 2019,Here's an honest review of the OnePlus 7T.Want a best phone under 40k go for this one without thinking twice. I'm saying this because i have literally researched every other phone falling under this category i.e. the ₹40000 bar.Pros1. Great display.  Seriously awesome display vivid colours and great brightness outdoors plus its a flat screen which is a big thumbs up coz I'm not really into curved displays for however pleasing they may look but in practicality not to good.2. Battery.  Battery life is just marvelous. Lasts for me about a whole day doing normal usage and 6-7 hours of heavy usage.Also Warp charge is just plain Awesome. Takes about 45 min to fully charge from 10-15%.3. Sound.  Dual stereo speakers are just great. Immersive sound experience. Loud and clear4. Oxygen OS  It is the best there is without any doubt. Better than samsung one ui or any other.5. Camera  Triple camera system is really good. Wide angle is 117° so a little short than other wide angles which are 120° but doesn't make any difference. Great pictures and videos.The macro shot is just great. Indoor and outdoor clicks are good. If your thinking iphone comparable quality just don't but is great for its price. Wouldn't regret buying it.Cons1. Minor bugs here and there that can be fixed with updates which is what OnePlus is good at.Updates are frequent and shows that they work really hard at this.2. Some people won't like the circular camera system so I'm writing in the cons but its just a matter of personal view. It doesn't bother you with anything.3. No 3.5 mm to type-c connector in the box.4. Some won't like the plastic TPU case but that's what you get.Anyhow it is the best phone there is right now better than OnePlus 7 pro and 7T pro actually.So no need to worry just go for it.If any questions just ask.If you are missing headphone jack buy a Bluetooth headset. I would recommend Sony WI400. 15 hrs battery. 1 hour charging time with warp charger ofcourse and pretty good range. Also great base and awesome sound. Priced at ₹3500.,0,Best OnePlus phone right now!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 5 December 2019,One plus company really care about their existing customer. I was using 1+ 5 for 2.5 years and company give 50 % off in battery replacement I paid 600 only. Bought 7t and they gave 2 year warranty as compliment. Big thank youAlways OnePlus fan.. had 1+ 5  but during Indian festival xchanged with 7t (got 9900 discount).People complain about battery but dude it's 90hz display and very powerful speakers.While playing pub battery drain too much but u don't require any headphone. U can easily hear footsteps without head phone.My brother is iOS guy he has 11 pro max.

kausar shaikh, 13 October 2019,It is heating up just after the nominal use of apps like Instagram. Cools down if I keep it idol for some time then I can use it further. I need a replacement with working product.UPDATE AFTER REPLACEMENT:I'm so glad that I requested the replacement I have no heating issues with the same usage on new phone.Many people suggested than this much is normal you will face same problems even after replacement becaues the hardware will be the same- what difference is it going to make upper right corner gets heated up and bla bla but it made the difference I love the phone now.There are bit of issues like - hanging while selecting images to upload on WhatsApp Instagram facebook etc once I had to restart to get back to function but I hope it will go away with software updates.P.S. this image issue I have noticed in 7 Pro as well.,One,Heating issue,5.0

Rajat P, 22 November 2019,I've been a surrounded by iOS. The only android I've used on a daily was way back to the 1st Gen Android Xperia X10i.Decided to switch to Android for functionality and my god it has been the best decision! 7T easily beats most of the devices in terms of practicality. Battery life is a little low but can't complaint because the Warp Charge makes up for it. 90Hz refresh rate makes other phones look primitive. Snapdragon 855 plus can take on any app/game you throw at it and all this superlative performance is backed by a finish that's no less than a ₹70k plus smartphone.In short Best phone you can buy on the market in Nov'19 period.,One,One Plus 7T 2 months later.

Rizwan Amir, 4 October 2019, Just finished setting it up and initial impressions have been very good. Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience.2 days usage Update:*About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same.*camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour.*Display is definitely the best part of the phone along with the processor SD 855+*Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear*Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage. And why worry much when we have warp 30T charger*I wish they could have included at least USB Type C Bullet earphones.*Overall quite content with the phone.,0,Surprisingly Good!

Harshil, 3 February 2020,Don't spend so much money in this phone. It's performance is same like any other redmi or other cheaper phone. I have used 5T. It was awesome.

Simeon, 17 October 2019,Upgraded from 6 to 7T. I always have been a OP fan. Everything is so perfect in this phone. So I don't want to share that the camera is bla bla or whatever. We all know OP makes best Android mobiles and Oxygen OS is incomparable. Touch is smooth as silk and performance outstands every other Android phones. The only thing I want to mark out is the battery. OP could have given atleast 4k mah battery. It drains really fast after continuous use.But yeah WARP charging is totally crazy. It's unbelievable.

MJ, 31 December 2019,Phone is truly a beast with all latest tech built within.Built quality - 10/10 with fine detailed finishing and sturdy device. Waterdrop notch i like it personally. But does not have notification lights(i personally prefer to have it).Camera - quality has improved drastically after latest update. Images are too good just loved it. Can be improved with some ar stickers and stuff to add fun element in camera.Android 10 OS - OS is a bit buggy where application and touch hangs abrubtly and issue is intermittent but definitely annoying as least you would you expect is smooth experience with software part after paying 39999₹ for the device. I think one plus have pushed android 10 bit early just for releasing updated oneplus 7t phone. They might resolve the issue with software upgrades.Sound - 10/10 Experience is very good with and without headphones. Phone comesnwith dual speaker and provides truly stereo effect.Battery - 7/10Battery charging is very quick with warp charging but it drains thatbquickly as well with minimal usage. It hardly lasts for me upto 20-24 hours(which i say is less from my past exp with other phones having similar battery capacity and non amoled display)Display - 10/10 You will definitely fall in love with the amoled display and video viewing experience is simply superb.,One,Truly a beast!!!

Amzn Customer, 14 October 2019,"This is my first Oneplus phone and bought this after a looooot of research. Happy to realize that my choice wasn't bad. Yeah if they release OP8 at a lesser price within next 2 months it's gonna hurt but that's the reality these days.Pros:1. Best camera in this range hands down. There are no second questions as of now. Color profiles vary a little when you switch between cameras but I'm sure next update from oneplus will solve this.2. Fastest phone in this range. ROG 2 is another option but that's for gamers and is not a practical phone for most people.3. Display 90Hz is super fluid. It isn't quad HD unlike 7 pro or 7T pro. But this is the best in this price range.4. Software: Android 10 plus Oxygen OS. I bought this phone for this combo. Best as of now. Zen mode night mode reading mode chromatic mode greyscale mode digital wellbeing dark mode the list goes on. You name it; this phone has it. Love it 3000.5. Speakers: Beast. Very loud and crisp.6. Design: 20:9 makes it easy to handle. Weight is balanced can manage most stuff with one hand. Rear can design may be a problem for some. Camera bump isn't an issue at all since everyone is going to use a case. My Moto Z had similar bump the case takes care of it.7. Battery: I wad skeptic about 3800mah plus 90Hz display combo. But this phone surprised me. Battery life is really good easily 5.30 to 6hrs SOT depending on your usage in 90Hz. If you are traveling you can always switch to 60Hz for longer life. Plus the super amazing charger. I think few early reviews dint have the latest oxygen update which should have improved the battery life.Cons:1. No 3.5mm output.2. No type-c to 3.5mm converter or type-c headphones in the box: Oneplus could at least give people a 100rs converter for buying a 40k phone. Who wants the useless super fancy box right?3. No IR blaster.4. No notification LED.5. No ""always on"" display.6. No micro sd slot.I can't think of any other con. Will update if I find any.Adding some amazing night mode pics shot by both stock camera and gcam. All these pics were shot at 10PM.Battery screenshot: Dint play any games. Usage was mostly whatsapp chrome camera and youtube. Dark Mode enabled. 90Hz enabled.Edit.Second screenshot: Includes 1hr 37 min pubg 1hr 15min youtube. Single sim wifi and 4g data always on did not use GPS much.",0,Best Oneplus phone till date?,5.0

Sometimes in the normal mode too.-Camera(2): No detail in photos when compared to other high end models in the market. Nevertheless the photos are amazing and you cannot find anything bad when you glance at it.-Crashing of apps (rare and common in Android)Summary: For the money and its value wrt options and perfromance its a great phone and a must buy.,0,iPhone -> Android,4.0
Kunal Bhatia✔️, 3 November 2019,Finish of the phone itself feels luxurious and well built.. Only issue is that it heats up while using the camera maybe this can be fixed via ota updates in the future. As of now 2 days of usage phone is quite stable and works just like a oneplus should..

You can actually see the difference if you had been using 60Hz screen earlier. Phone doesn't hang and extremely smooth transition between application.Phone can take up large size games like Fifa Mortal Combat Pubg Asphalt etc without any heating in the device and moreover by default settings is HD which is pretty impressive.Battery(3.5/5): Can last long. But compare to other previous series of One Plus slightly on lesser side. I don't consider it drawback and can be adjusted with.Sounds(5/5): Perfect Dolby system. Clear and crisp.Touch(5/5): Smooth. Easy finger sensing.Camera(5/5): Absolutely fantastic.  Micro mode is just amazing and pictures doesn't fade out. Face lock also work fantastically apart from basic triple camera.Aesthetics(4/5): Width wise you may find it pretty less as compared to other phones in the market in similar category. But hardly noticeable. Light weight. Round camera on the back might bother you but it has come with great protection so you don't need to worry about it.You will not have audio jack. Hence you will have to but C type converter.,0,Sleek Smooth and Amazing but can be best with greater battery life.,4.0

Arnab Roy, 28 October 2019,The battery optimisation is extremely poor. The battery just drains like anything. Needs to be charged twice a day. One cannot carry the wrap charger everywhere.Wrap charger is great but that dosent call for total lack for battery optimisationespecially when you are putting a powerhungry 855+ and battery consuming 90htz screen.Rest of the phone is just awesome. Oneplus needs to address this heating and battery draining issue as soon as possible with better optimisation like Huawei (the smaller battery have great life better than even big battery)They Must roll out update to fix this issue..

Piyush Anand, 3 November 2019,Everything Is almost fineBut when it comes to fingerprint sensor and battery it sometimes disappoints.1.fingerprint is fast but not too fast plus many a times cause problem in fingerprint reading and hence uses face unlock.2.battery is draining fastly even in 60hz refresh rate and that's a bit disappointing me I expected something more better from one plus.battery never felt like what they said.3.lots of heat up.4.some software bugs but they can be fixed with updates so they are good and some missing also but the major problem are the above three.Though it's a 2day usage view of me if any thing more come to me will update it as well.Battery draining is worst but backed up y ultra fast warp charge 30T,One,battery drainage and heat up,3.0
Manjubala, 30 November 2019,I like OXYGEN OS with 90HZ refresh rate which is the smoothest ever I had ever used so far.This is my first flagship phone over 30K .bought for 33500 after all discounts.Pros:SoftwareCamera -sony 48 MP blows like anything.Charging speed with 30W wrap charges within 50 minutes .Sound quality .It is clear and crispy.Dolby with stereo speakers are amazing.Cons-Battery capacity is bit smaller.But the phone is not much weight and it is so slim because of compromise on battery capacity.This couldn't be a problem with charger given out of box.There are no other cons for me.It is the best in UI .Those who are wishing to experience best UI and watch more videos can buy it blindly.,One,OXYGEN OS,4.0
abhineet, 8 October 2019,The device is addictive..Performance is very good..After an update the ambient display feature stopped working I complained and requested for replacement however it started again automatically...In a seven week time the phone came out the be winner.The battery is small and gives 8-10hrs now to heavy user and 15-20 hrs to light with 90 htz refresh rate setting. However at 60htz refresh rate the battery performance increases manyfold and is more than sufficient.. it is surprising that in the starting the battery performance is not very good but as I used the device the battery performance has increased so much. The one plus team should also include battery health feature like iPhone.FRONT camera is not as wow as rear..Needed improvement for sure..If one plus team is reading this then you guys should enhance front camera quality..Ear phones is not included in the box.. which one plus should include as they have not given 3.5mm jack..Overall I would rate 4.7 out of 5 now.. also this is the third time I am editing my review and each time my ratings have only increased..There are some heating issues which I recently encounter.. and when the phone heated this time it's ambient display feature again stopped working.. something unsual from one plus.,0,Must read,5.0

Nitish Pandit, 4 December 2019,After using it for 3 days I would say with assurance that it is the best buy in the range between 30k to 38k. Fingerprint sensor is lightning fastface unlock is good.

SUDIREDDY RAJA SHEKAR REDDY, 31 May 2020,I bought it for 35k in the month of May. I was in a dilemma between OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 7t. But after watching reviews on YouTube and my friend's experience on using OnePlus 8 I've decided to go for 7t only. This is my honest review after using this mobile for a day. This mobile is one of the best looking performance centric mobiles that I've used in my life. Literally I felt so happy and satisfied after using this mobile. For 35k it a paisa vasool mobile.

Amit Garg, 23 January 2020,The biggest con of this phone is battery. It won't stay for full day after a full charge. Drains too quickly. Attached is the image. Also battery drains faster in battery saver mode which defeats its purpose. Since there is no return I have to live with this phone. The standard cover provided by company is tacky. They could hv included a proper cover for such a price. Oh and not to mention the packaging. Whosoever packed it packed it thinking it's a brick and not a phone and I could see the delivery person tossing the packages so one can imagine the condition of phone which isn't properly packed.  Overall not satisfied with spending so much.Edited:After using it for couple of months found out that camera quality is cheap.  Zoom just simply worst not even 8 megapixel.

Charging is super fast. No complains phone is ready for use in half n hour.3. Overall performance RAM management storage speeds oxygen OS 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.Some negatives:-1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.4. A major problem for one who has small hands is that the phone is very tall.

Gairik Mandal, 2 November 2019,BUILD QUALITY:very well built..CAMERA:not the bestbut good in this price segmentDISPLAY:very good quality display.brightness is very good.color sharpnesscontrast is nice.SECURITY:in display fingerprint is fast and accurate.the face unlock is fast and accurate and work in low light..SOFTWARE:it is not the best from oneplus.oxygen os contains some bugs which is very annoying and decline user experience.BETTERY:this is the weakest point of the phone.you will get six to seven hours of screen on time with 60 Hz display mode and with 90Hz it decline to four to five hour.But the charging speed is good.The 30t charger charge the phone 0 to 100 in just about one hour.SOUND QUALITY:It has one of best sound quality.it is loud and clear.Base is good,0,Review after one month of use :Very good overall package at great price except poor battery life..,4.0
kranthi kumar, 2 October 2019,I was skeptical before but after purchasing the phone I'm completely satisfied with it.Pros:1. Refresh rate of 90hz makes the transitions fluid.2. You get Android 10 out of box.3. Oxygen os is close to stock Android so it's not full of bloatware  and is free of any ads4. The unboxing experience is worth mentioning.5. The triple camera setup does a commendable job.Cons:1. Battery of 3800 mAh is considerably less. The phone lasts a day  with 9hrs screen on time2. If you are switching from iPhone then you'll face little hickups  while transferring the data.3. There's no headphone jack so you'll have to go with a Bluetooth  headset or have to buy an extra connector,One,Worth the price go for it!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 16 October 2019,First of all their is no comparison just go for it without a single thought fast finger print sensor. Face unlock is so fast and work till 5 foot steps so be aware anyone can unlock your phone specially recommended to those who are in relationship😅😅.Camera is awesome even in low light you can get best shots I don't think we need some extra lens for micro photography as OnePlus is already giving. If you want to make video while walking you can do because the stability is amazing.Battery life is not so good not so bad I can say average and the best part is warp charger which will charge 100% within 50-55minsAs every mobile adapting wireless technology but still if there will be earphones jack port will be there it's good to have.,One,Best in market,5.0
Ravdeep, 2 December 2019,Pros:1. Best stereo speakers system available in any phone till date.2. Best camera among phones below 40k.3. Warp charge charges phone 0 to 100% in under 1 hr.4. OxygenOS with Android 10 is the best android skin ever.Cons:1. No headphone jack.2. Group selfiles from front camera will blurr the participants standing behind even in normal mode.3. No type-C to 3.5mm adaptor or type-C headphones provided in the box.,0,Best phone for its price,5.0
Raj Verma, 31 October 2019,Its 7 day user review..First of all i would tell that performance and screen are at the best..i will give performance 10/10And screen 9.5/10 with 90hz display it is like butter..and oxygen os is really a great UIAnd the camera is just cool..but some times it lacks details and noisy pictures i know its the problem of software.. hope oneplus will give major update on the camera..i will give the camera 8.5/10And battery is just ok..not much and also not less..It give screen on time upto 6 hours with 90hz ..and with full charge we can play pubg upto 3.5 hours with full graphics HDR setting..and if we do it 60hz than we can play pubg upto 4 hours..and one major good thing is its warp charge..with 30 watt..i have tested.. averagely it takes about 55 min to 58 min for full charge thats really amazing..and normal usage its long last for whole day.. i will give battey 8/10But overall its really a great phone and value for money..if u want an all-around phone then go for it .If you want for gaming purpose then go for asus rog phone 2..Although in my choice i will go only for OnePlus 7T..,One,Great phone value for money.. performance and display are great..,5.0
Amazon Customer, 12 October 2019,Here is what I feel about the mobile.If you have budget to spend 36000 rupees (which will easily be used for 3-4 years so ROI is pretty cool) either in single payment or through EMI. I suggest to go for it. Its a great phone in the price tag.Once a smart person said : You cannot go wrong with oneplus and I felt the same way.Hit Features of the phone :The 90Hz display is a delight to work with.Camera.The software(it's as important as the great specs a phone offers)Smallest notch.Audio quality.Premium looks and feel.Shortcomings:Sab maaf..!!People are complaining about it's battery life. Though it's early to say but it has a pretty decent battery backup and fast charging is again what makes this phone a strong buy.What I want to say is I loved this and won't disappoint you either ..!! ❤️,One,Don't overthink..!! Just buy the god damn phone..!! 😂,5.0
sandip sarkar, 16 October 2019,Simply it's the best smartphone you can buy today below 50k best in class screen with 90hz display fastest fast charging  fastest processing unit with Snapdragon 855+ 8GB ram triple setup camera with 1st of a kind macro mode what else could we want from a phone priced at half as that of the other flagship devices .It's a significant upgrade over previous 6TIt's wiser to go for the one plus 7t than goin for 7pro or 7T ProIf you dig deep and really want to find a few Cons then I'd say -1. no wireless charging2.battery life could have been better but can easily switch to 60hz display to get extra juice out of the batary3.screen pixel density not as high as samsung n google pixel4. Round triple  camera setup looks strange at first but gets used to soon .,0,Best smartphone you can buy below 50K,5.0
Anil Bejugam, 5 December 2019,I like this phone it could have better on few things1) very fast it dry out2) not happy with Camera quality3) Not having gesture controls like moto-- flast light double tap to lock etc.Pros.1) Very quick charging need to wait long time this is one of the best option i seen2) balanced phone  hardly skip from your hand,One,Low Battery life and Camera,3.0
Pankaj Jain, 30 April 2020,upon using the phone for now 4 months I have the following things to share :- great price- looks r great (even the back camera doesn't look bad)- the gaming experience is amazing (tried pubg call of duty sims roller coaster tycoon sim city and many more) it works great with all with no issue (MUST TRY FNATIC MODE!! ITS INSANE)- some apps are showing issues where some apps are stretched beyond the screen- camera works great better than a lot of Samsung products in the same price range- sound quality is insanea phone worth buying,One,Getting features like samsung s series for half the price!,5.0
Swapnali patil, 1 March 2020,This mobile is more than awesome except it's bettery life. Battery drains faster than it's charging speed. Only if u don't use mobile after charging then battery will last for a day. Other than this i can't complaint about anything else. Other eatures are absolutely lovable. Camera features are more than anything u can ask for. There are many modes in camera settings to capture images in different situations which i liked the most! Easy and faster to use. Overall loving this mobile.,0,Overall good featurs | bad battery life,4.0
Mudabir habib, 7 October 2019,Dear friend don't take this phone  too much hanging problem photos get blur when u try to send photos to others like through watsup or other  apps battery backup is also not so good ,2,Don't take this device and don't get ur money waste,2.0
Kishanu Karmakar, 4 June 2020,OnePlus which is my favorite phone I already have Oneplus 6 phone which I have been using from last 2 years. The reason for taking the oneplus 7t phone its RAM and speed charging. Time to time updates keep coming in this phone so even if a bug is seen the team of Oneplus correct with in a month. Battery life is really good and fingerprint reader is too fast recognise.,0,Battery life is really good and fingerprint reader is too fast recognise,5.0
Nekkanti Jayram, 9 February 2020,My First review and its genuine for buyers .Phone is good. Display is excellent. Chargeing speed is amazing. But some things are still not upto the mark which are below.1) software updates are not quicker and not recent it's still in November security patch2) Camera us not up to the mark as like flagship phones.3) Battery life is not so amazing but decent.Last but not least I did not felt much premium when using this phone.,0,Review after 2 weeks of usage,4.0
Satish Mayekar, 25 November 2019,Low Light Photography is still not improved also we've observed much noise and distortion in captured image.I hope post Zoom what will happen is no need to say.Market is flooded with 48 MP phones in low price budget. But in spite being at so high price range Camera is not up to the mark.Front Camera scanning in face unlocking doesn't found to be super quick.In good light this does capture nice images like other brands available in market right now.In short at least this Camera Lense doesn't give that Wow kinda feel or something amazing outcome.Battery Life :- As per use it's sufficient. But interesting thing is it's charging speed amd time required. Good note for it.Fingerprint Sensor :- This Sensor works better and at quick lightning unlocking.,0,Camera.. Not As Expected ..!!,4.0
Sunny, 21 December 2019,Switched from Oneplus 3 to 7T.Main reason for sticking to Oneplus was there software support over long term. Oxygen OS is veey snappy combined with best hardware till date.The performance difference between OP3 and OP7T is very big. I was comfortable with performance of OP3 till i started using 7T.Web page renderinganimations are very fluid(maybe due to 90hz refresh).Design wise i like narrow ergonomic design.It is confortable for one hand usage though it is slightly heavy. Buttons are very tactile and clikcy.The alert slider is much better compared to one on OP3.Camera is good nothing exceptional.Speakers are very good for media and call.Display brightness is slightly low could have been better.I don't like the notch. It ruins overall experience.Most of the time it is hidden in black bars and most video playback don't support notch(tested in ChromeAmazon Prime).Moreover video content is very limited for this aspect ratio as of now.Battery life is average. Same as three year old OP3.If you are heavy user and always on the gothen it may not last till evening.(I always keep 90hz onelse what's the use of paying for such feature.)A bigger battery is definitely a miss here.I really miss 3.5mm jack. Bluetooth options are convinient but not good as wired earphones.The price/quality of Bluetooth options is way below wired earphones. You will have to go for ANC bluetooth headsets to get decent quality audio experience.I have ordered type c wired earphone to see if it is any better.Overall a good buy for the price. I hope they don't raise price further into Samsung/Apple range.,0,Nice upgrade,4.0
Veena, 15 October 2019,I've never been so impressed with a phone before. This is my third OnePlus phone after OnePlus X and 3T. I'm becoming a huge fan of OnePlus thanks to the top quality devices they manufacture at affordable rates. The camera is so good and the macro will make you wanna take pictures of everything lying around the house. Screen quality is superb. I get 24 hour battery backup with 5-7 hour screen on time. Absolutely worth every rupee.,0,Best phone you can buy in India,5.0
Amazon Customer, 5 February 2020,I think this could be one of the honest reviews !I have bought One plus 7T a month back. This phone is great and very fast. I am a general user who uses it for Insta some work files and clicking photos and this is doing great for me.What I feel is there's room for improvement in battery life and fingerprint reader.Overall this phone is a great buy !,One,A good phone,5.0
Dr. Apurba Kr.Rabha, 29 December 2019,Pros:-Excellent performance-Good display (Not better than Samsung's display)-Fast WRAP charger-Versatile cameras due to 3 lenses-Oxygen OS on android 10Cons:-No headphone jack (I really miss it)-Battery just average-Camera just average-one plus accessories are expensive ( like USB type c to 3.5mm jack Bluetooth earphone)-overall expensive to other competitors-NO WATER RESISTANCE (my old Samsung galaxy s7 had which is much cheaper now),One,Value for money !,4.0
Biju Mathew K, 3 July 2020, The Oneplus quality is just a gimmick item started showing problems from the very first start. took 5 minutes  for the first startup then hanged... storage 100% occupied by the system then it started blinking (you can see in the video). Immediately tried to book a return/ replacement. But they said they need a technicians visit first and he will come after 12 days. Very dissatisfied.. If you plan to buy a Oneplus device.. Think Twice,0,Item defective and cannot open,1.0
Sa Ku, 17 November 2019,Its really butter smooth.90hz display is amazing. After using my OP7T a while if I hold my iPhone 6s I feel how smooth my OP7T is.Camera is awesome. Batter backup is ok for one day regular (emails whatsap upto 1h of phone calls and few photos). Charging speed is very very fast. It charges from 10% to 100% in 55mins.Overall I am satisfied with the product.Buy official 3D tempered glass from OnePlus then you wont feel that you have pasted a glass on your phone.,0,Overall I am satisfied with the product.,5.0
Deepak chandak, 6 June 2020,I was have one plus 5 one plus 6 T and now one plus 7 T but this time I am not satisfied with one plus product.It's battery is even not as good as one plus 5.One plus 5 has 3300 mah and one plus 7 T has 3800 mah but it's not worth.Looking is good but functioning is not as good as its price and expectations.,2,One plus now decreased it's quality of product,3.0
Rohit, 23 April 2020,If this phone is in your budgetDo not have second thoughts just go for itI have been using this phone for quite a long time now and I just love its designscreen and everything else.The phone charges in 60 minutes from 0 to 100 and that's just a spec which other phones these days don't provide.Love the Oneplus 7t.,2,Best Phone,5.0
Avb Prasad, 4 December 2019,Battery backup is  poor when compared to1 plus 6. Lasting only for 12 to 14 hours.While attending the call  suddenly hold button or the mute button are getting activated causingcall disruption.While attending a call automatically it is dialing some other contacts without our attempt. These are some of the difficulties  I am experiencing. Impressed by the performance of the 1 plus 6  (which I was using before this) I went for 7 T. But now I am repenting my decision.,One,7T needs improvement.,3.0
Omkar pawar, 3 October 2019,Awesome Mobile.....thanks amazon for a lot discount.....overall mobile is so fantastic.... I've never found any cons in the mobile except 1 thing battery drainage 😅 but its ok because of 7t warp charge charging speed is very good. I got Amazon 3 day delivery. And the overall experience was too good....so happy...🥰,One,Great deal from amazon....,5.0
Dr Pratik Goswami, 16 October 2019,Oneplus always surpasses expectations as we all know. This phone is build so perfect and beautiful my iphone user friends are even jealous with the design and make.Pros:# beautifully premium design with glass back and matte but metallic looking glacier finish. I dont like motorised parts like in reno or 7pro design feel unsafe to me.# processor os ultra fast finger print reader is fastest i know of screen is mesmerising though i feel a very little difference as compared to my samsung s7 edge screen refresh rate i dont know how to make out difference so no point there tbh.# price rnage is okkay. Not pricey not cheap.# battery life is awesome considering 90hz refresh rate and samoled display with 855+ processor.# everything else u cna think about is pros only.Cons:# gboard google keyboard is okayish as compared to apple and samsung keyboards im getting misclicks and misspelled words accuracy is too much i think apple has so much optimised keyboards so does samsung i think oneplus and google will work on it.# camera performace is just fine in low light tbh apple 11 will surely shot better pics in low light i think.# i hv watched on youtube about life of back glass they said it is prone to develop scratches over time i dont know though lets see.# headfone jack was removed. My heart broke its not a good movement we have senheiser and all 3.5mm headfone jacks why r u removing these guys its basic thing shifting from micro usb to type c usb plug is different thing but this is not at all fair we are forced to buy third party connectors which practically ruins the atmos effects many of us dont like wireless. Thumb down here. As a gesture of goodwill you could provide connector in the box at least yeah its not there in the box buy from outside.# no colour option for 256gb version as of now only glacier blue not a big issue but its a bit funky. Not like like for everyone.,0,Perfect and at a sweet point🙂,5.0
Revati, 13 October 2019,I am shocked to see issues with this phoneIT HANGS!!especially the gallery doesn't work for sharing photos at times and then I have to restart the phone.I had to restart my phone since very first day of starting useSound quality not very exceptional. It is okI don't know if these problems can be solved by replacingVibration is so smooth that you never come to know that your phone is vibratingPlease everything is tolerable But phone at this price range and claiming the 8GB RAM must not hang !!Rest all the things are superb with this phone,One,Very Nice product but long way to go OnePlus,4.0
Sasi Kumar, 11 January 2020,Was planning to buy Samsung M30 for my wife. But after reading about lot of issues with the model went for OnePlus 7T. Double the price but I'm happy I chose this. No it is not fair to compare the two models but the pathetic quality of M30 with network signal and connectivity issues it definitely is not worth 14k+Coming back to 7T there's hardly anything negative noticed after a week of usage. Camera is top notch low light shots are excellent battery lasts more than a day even with maximum use of mobile data and WiFi.Will update this review after a month.,0,A wise decision,4.0
Gurkirat Singh, 9 October 2019,Ordered the product on the first day of its launch... I don't know if it's just me but the phone keeps on hanging in between... It's been a week since I'm using it and it's frozen atleast 5-6 times already.Sometimes there are issues with finger recognition too... Seems like some quality defect or what.. even the battery doesn't last for that long. I uogarded myself from one plus 5 to this but Im not impressed with battery life. The only good thing is camera.,One,Not so impressive,4.0

Amazon Customer, 26 October 2019,I ordered this product on Wednesday 23rd October and received by me on 26th October. This phone looks good now. It drain battery after rough use of 3 hours but thanks to the quick charger it's bumps the battery level to from 30% to 85% within 25 minutes.I would be possible posting more reviews after using it for atleast 10 days.One issue is i could not find the tampered glass which fits it correctly.The phone should be handled carefully since it has 6+ inches of screen.Display looks so good.Camera is awesome and captures best quality of photos.

Camera performance display everything is up to the mark. Build quality is quite good and in hand feels quite premium.Dolby Atmos speakers is another plus point. It's true Dolby Atmos feeling while listening. Camera is very impressive both indoor and outdoor it takes decent pictures. 4k recording is super cool and EIS and OIS makes video shooting experience more enhanced.90hz refresh rate of screen feels true amoled smoothness. Gaming performance is extremely smooth. No lag and heating found while playing COD mobile on extream settings.Last but not least charging is super fast so no need to worry about battery drain.

We just need all these factors to buy a phone ri8 so I think you should buy it . I my self is loving it and planning to use this for long periods of time .

Harish naik, 12 October 2019,My 2nd OnePlus phone ❤️ Camera Awesome. Battery will last a day. Since I use it for gaming it doesn't drain much. Go for it guys. High end phone  under 40k don't waste it on some other brand. Used OnePlus 5t for 2 year not even single issue in it. But only thing is they won't give type-c to 3.5mm jack converter. You need to buy it separately from OnePlus website.,2,Just go for it. You won't Regret. OnePlus ❤️,5.0
Shreya, 28 November 2019,One plus 7t is super awesome... Unbeatable experience... Camera quality is Just wow... Just one minus point is the battery for such a High performing mobile they should have given a battery with a longer life but it can be managed sonce they have provided with the warp charger which charges the mobile in less than an hour,One,Must buy !!,5.0
Kanishka Malhotra, 26 November 2019,Love the all-round experience of this beast of a phone. This is my third OnePlus phone in the last 3.5 years and I wouldn't deny that they always exceed the expectations of the users. Fingerprint reader is a bit meh (doesn't recognize at times) but you can make do with it. Camera quality is REALLY GOOD. I use my OnePlus 7T on 90Hz always (yes I am addicted to that smooooth experience) and yet the battery works like a charm for me. At the end of my day of moderate usage I still have at least 40% juice left which is commendable (considering 90Hz). All in all I'm totally delighted to use this phone!,One,It's such a smooooth experience!,5.0

Amazon Customer, 13 March 2020,"Well its a down to earth honest review of OnePlus 7T after using it for one month. First thing this phone is made for single guys like me as it says ""Never Settle"" well just kidding. I replaced my old Samsung Galaxy A30 and decided to go for OnePlus for the first time. Well it paid off superbly. It is a real flagship killer at this price range and it makes Iphone and Samsung look bad to some extent. Coming to the performance its blazing fast with that sweet Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor and 8GB of ram. The fingerprint scanner is also super fast and well designed too. The fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate was something that the OnePlus first introduced it in the market and rest all other smartphone company just followed along the standards set by OnePlus on its flagship device. With 1 month of usage I found the following important pros:-1) Blazing fast - do not worry about lags anymore.2) Network connectivity with this phone is also superb as OnePlus claims it is due to the new processor that results in 15% faster network acquisition. Downloads are blazing fast on Airtel 4G3)Oxygen OS v10 based on stock android 10 - the OS is clean with less junk and far better in performance than other OS by respective companies like MIUI OneUI etc.4)90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution of 2400 X 1080 - Videos and games feel ever so smooth.5) Gaming - its not a gaming centric phone by any extent like Asus ROG 2 but gets the job done and has even higher benchmark performance score than the ROG 2. The Adreno 640 GPU can handle the games at pretty high graphics setting @60 fps too.6) The feature of Gestures makes life a hell lot of easier for me.7) The UFS storage 3.0 makes copy and paste operations much more smoother and faster.8) The 30T warp charger is just amazing. 0 to 70% in 30 mins and 0 to 100% in 50 mins.Every smartphone however great will always have some cons these are:-1)No 3.5mm headphone jack - OnePlus deliberality does this to cut costs so that it can pack up the phone on other features.2) No SD card slot - when u have the UFS Storage 3.0 you dont really need a SD card slot. OnePlus claims it slows down the phone.3) Battery - well larger battery doesn't always mean more screen time as seen in Google Pixel or even Iphone where battery is not very big but they have great power backup and screen time. Same is with OnePlus 3800 mAh can get the job done in most number of days but still feels a bit less when you are performing GPU intensive stuff for a long time like gaming.4) Camera - the only thing this phone lags behind as compared to other smartphones in the same price range is the camera. OnePlus has failed to impress me with the Camera on this phone. At this price range they are only giving EIS and 2x zoom with only a 16MP front selfie camera. While taking broad daylight photos you may notice that the colour may be oversaturated to some extent( a red flower may appear pink in photos). Low light photos at night look superb though. If you are looking for a better camera phone then OnePlus 7T may not be your choice.5) Notch design - Some people may like it some may not its your own personal preference. I personally do not like it because it obscures the display of some apps and videos.6) No official IP rating :- well you are never sure when the phone may give up when it is exposed to water as there is no official IP rating. So use it carefully in rainy season especially. OnePlus says its next smartphones will all have official IP rating.",0,A powerful phone with a decent camera at a superb price.,5.0
Arjun, 27 June 2020,Finger print reader is not that great. It takes turns to detect sometimes.Battery life is ok. Under 90 Hz Screen Refresh Rate I m getting one and half day battery life. I don't play any games. No social media too. Just normal usage. OnePlus should increase battery strength.Camera is awesome. Screen AMOLED display is very good. Android 10 has many options to use. Great speakers too.,One,Good but need certain changes.,3.0
Vasant Vihar, 21 June 2020,First time OnePlus user. Previously used Xiami Nokia Samsung Motorola etc. This phone is blazing fast compared to all previous makes. Fingerprint reader super fast. Camera good. Battery lasts a day with average usage. I got about 60 % charging in 30minutes as against advertised 70%. Battery mAh could have seen some improvement. All in all a lovely top notch product. Will review in few months of usage if issues found.,0,Lovely fast n worth the money,4.0

Andy Iyengar, 3 November 2019,"For someone who upgraded from an Android 7.0 phone the OnePlus 7T is a sea change.After watching innumerable reviews & comparisons between the 7T & 7T Pro i finally settled in on the 7T as it's a VFM product & the 14 K premium that the 7T Pro commands doesn't seem worth it for what it offers IMHO.It's been a week since I am using it the display the finger print scanner and the face unlock all works blazing fast including the charging. The battery lasts about a day for my moderate to heavy usage which is acceptable. Yes there are better battery phones out there but the fast charging makes up for that small gap.Camera is good  however can't compare it to the iPhones or high end Samsung's.The one feedback i would like to give is to provide a Type C headset in the Box which would have given the customer a feel good factor at this price point.Enough has been written about Oxygen OS and it's indeed worth writing about. There are enough customizations to keep most people happy.All in all it's been a great start and I look forward to ""Never Settle"" with the OnePlus 7T",0,A Worthy Upgrade,5.0
Swagatam Pati, 7 October 2019,The Phone is good but Amazon's delivery is worst. The fingerprint sensor is awesome but you need to update your fingerprint data time to time to get the best experience. The camera quality is good not great. If you are just want good photos just go for it but you will not get those mind blowing photos and the low light performance is good but in nightscape mode you will experience artificial colours and lighting. Battery takes 45-50 mins (approx) for 0-100%. But battery life is not that great and yes you will find a lot of bugs in this phone. The build is fabulous and will feel like a premium phone in hand but as the rear camera is bulging out it gets scratches. The selfie camera is good not great. The performance of this phone is really great and you will definitely love that 90Hz display but it is not a 4k display. Coming to the point should you buy it? Yes definitely if your budget is 40k max and u want something which is really fast and features packed. Comparing it with the realme x2 pro if u have a tight budget then go for realme or else u should go for it and u will never be disappointed. For gaming purpose- yes this is a great device but for only gaming go for the Asus rog phone 2. For camera purpose- yes this  performs well but not extraordinary. So for camera u can go for iPhone or google pixel. But still then its a great device. The speakers display build camera is worth the price u pay. Yes its overpriced by 4k-5k but still you should go for it. And yes to quote please go for the 256gb variant because the storage is enough to provide you with peace of mind.,One,Jack of all trade.,4.0
Amazon Customer, 13 October 2019,Phone is extremely fast modern looking and looks amazing with the original OP7T sandstone case. Easy to set up and use.However the dimensions are a little too big and it becomes unwiedly to use. I would rather have a smaller screen with same specs.,One,Great specs a little too big for my liking,4.0
Soumen M., 30 May 2020,Hello dear buyersI am writing this review after using this product for 6 months.Let's come directly to the point:1. Super fast phone.2. Fingerprint reader and face detection is so fast some time I thought whether I have set any screen lock option or not.3. Camera is too good. Night mode is too good. Some images also attached.4. Video quality is superb.5. Surround sound is too good.6. Phones speaker are really awesome.7. Best part is after playing game like pubg continuously for 1.5 hour handset is not getting warm that much that is the thing which I love the most.8. Charging oh my God it's too fast.9. Battery back for a moderate user it will last just above 24 hours and for a heavy user you may need to charge the device twice in 24 hours of time span.10. If you are a moderate user and looking to buy a device which you want to use at least 3 to 4 years then you can go for this product blindly.11. Only one problem so far which I realized that is it is not possible to buy a costly phone like this every time for a middle class person. As it was my dream to own a OnePlus so I did it. Actually the thing is this phone is so fast that you are not going to even like any other phones in mid range segment. After using this product I realized that my budget has increased alot for the coming future days. 😊,0,It was a dream.. 😊,5.0
Ranjith goud, 15 May 2020,Still a flagship killer in 2020I choose 7t over 8 because both have many similarities and i would like to go for good bluetooth earphones instead of spending extra money on oneplus 8,3,Still a good choice in 2020,5.0
Paplesh Gour, 20 December 2019,Nice product from one plus as usual. Below are the details.Got it in discount. Around 33k is the greate deal for it.ProsNice display with acurate colors.Decent sound quality.Greate UIAndroid 10 OOBNo heating issues so farWrap charging is greate phone can be charged fully withine 40-50 min.ConsFront camera needs to be improved.Battery life could be more better in the segment.,0,Greate phone,5.0
Harshit Jain, 8 November 2019,I am happy to buy this phone. The UI though misses a few features but it's minimalistic approach and close to stock experience enriches the performance. Camera is at its best. The low is best though it struggles sometime to focus in low light but that would be fixed in the next two or three updates. Talking about performance it is the best. Do not compare it with ROG Phone II because OnePlus offers great camera and design as well. I was bit disappointed with its battery life. If you've power source then it won't matter because it charges too fast.90Hz display is best. Oxygen OS has nicely optimized Dark Mode as well.I feel Oxygen OS 10 needs more stability right now.,0,It is a mix of everything at its best.,5.0
bcd, 6 July 2020,I am first-time oneplue phone buyer.I liked the OS speed and display.But my phone has an issue with network. Network suddenly drops either we need restart the device or select and deselect Aeroplane mode.When I asked Amazon for replacement they have asked for factory reset to check the issue. And issue didn't came for few days(till replacement period over).I have visited the OnePlus  service store they are useless.And many people are facing same issue I understand when looked into the OnePlus community.Looks like I have to use the same falty divice till the next phone.,0,Faltu phone,1.0
Venkata Durga rao, 29 November 2019,My experience with OnePlus 7t. I will dive with pros and consPros.1.super fast charging around 30-45 minutes for full charge.2. Good performance3. Very good stereo speakersCons:1. Camera quality is average can't compare with iPhones but at the price one plus should have given improved camera,2,Review after one month usage,3.0
Govind Dhar, 23 June 2020,Reason to like it1. Awesome display 👌 quality punchy colours2.Top class performances ultra smooth experience lage free3.Top class ram manegement4.Superfast Face recognition(but not realibel) and also fast fingerprint sensor.5. Unbelievable charging speed. In 0-72% charge just 30 minutes it's crazy.6. Best class dual speaker and cystel clear sound experience with Dolby Atmos.6.Value for 💰 MoneyReason to dislike1.Battery capacity some little bit extra then this phone bang. But warp charge technology speed maneg it2. Mean reason some people to not buy its....... missing 3.5 mm audio jack. Including im miss this. OnePlus in future please study indian need and do not ditch audio jack.3. And finally 📷 Camera- its not a top class. Means not too bad not good im rating it Good+. But some how i hope this phone camera some improvement then its bang. But its not a impossible.Overall great phone. Dont hassitate if your budget under 35k then buy it. And also some people miss expandebel micro SD card slot. But this phone already inbuilt 128GB internal storage. And in this present time maximum people stream videos song movie watching and listening in online. And even store your personal data like- photo contact etc store in cloud server so my thinking inbuilt storeg it's enough for daily useg. If you need extra storage go to 256GB version but you can also pay 3k rupee extra.Thanks to everyone 😊,0,Honest Review of OnePlus 7T,4.0
saikumar, 7 January 2020,Writing this review after observing for 2weeks. I have bought this as present for my wife and mobile looks elegant and one will fall in love upon looking at it. All these years I have had misconceptions that China made mobiles can never live upto quality that iPhone has. But to my surprise one plus has designed this phone par to iPhone (screen clarity)..features camera clarity are excellent. However portrait mode could have been better. And finger print reader fails to recognise at times.. I haven’t explore the mobile and its available features to the core yet..product delivered as it featured here.,0,Nice elegant and met my expectations,4.0
Verified Customer, 5 October 2019,It's a beast.OnePlus proves themselves with every product.Unbeatable in every manner.Camera Performance ChargingEverything is just like Vow...Quality product.For those who are buying it without thinking about ROG phone 2 will know the power of OnePlus. OnePlus is uncompromising form the beginning.Battery backup:-5 hours screentime on 90 Hertz while playing PubgMobile on HDR Extreme Frame Rate.No lagBut still game is not optimised so may experience just Flickers. Nothing else . Everything Renders even with 8X Scope.So apart form Gaming. This device meets your expectations compared with others and found this.,0,Quality Performance Everything,5.0
Karan Chandok, 10 October 2019,Just used it today for the first day. Nothing too great. Battery life is average. Charges fast though. Phone heats up very quick. I would say not a good upgrade from the 6T.If you have a 6T you can avoid this one.,3,Very average upgrade,3.0
Hemant_Rhtdm5, 26 October 2019,Amazing camera quality 😍However as compared to iPhone X OnePlus pictures are little color saturated but many of us like it that way.. so it saves time editing pictures and also lot of money unlike apple devices ;)OnePlus 7T camera really surprised me specially for night and low light photography.It also has a wide angle camera.Great screen size.Comes with screen guard and mobile cover.Dash charging is superb.Totally happy. I should have bought 256GB model though. It's just 2k more than this one which has 128GB.,0,Mind blowing camera.. OnePlus just nailed it.,5.0

Saurabhsabarwal, 18 January 2020,Took The one plus 7t this month good battery life good camera  very fast processor. Just one drawback  the voice clarity during making calls is not that clear !

Omkar Singh, 8 October 2019,Great fan of OnePlus and I was user of OnePlus 5t and now upgraded to OnePlus 7T.Actually I was waiting for the 7T since the launch of oneplus 7 because I knew 7T will stand up to the mark. And they proved it..Superb phone with lots of interesting features which will never let you keep your phone down ( so we have zen mode 😋 ),One,It's a,5.0
Amazon Customer, 1 December 2019,Alright got the device on the third day after ordering it delivery was amazing. The package was nicely packed and the delivery guy was very polite but it took me around 10-12 calls to connect to him he didn't bother to pick them up otherwise it was fine.Now coming to the main topic = OnePlus 7tEverything is good played pubg for an hour ran smoothly battery drained about 5-6%But the only dislike is camera according to the price I think it could have done a little better than it does nowRest the phone is good.,One,It's not that amazing but,4.0
8978675508, 3 October 2019,Features are good . But battery draining too fast. .. And 1 to2  bugs .. Found. Rest of the things good... Before I used Nokia 8.1 that back cam is awesome. Same like this also  but I felt sometimes that is good.,3,Battery draining very fast.,3.0
anirudh bengeri, 21 December 2019,My very first one plus experience. OnePlus 7T is the best product available in the market with 855+ fastest processor.The variant i have is glacier blue 8/256gb. It fastest in the segment and the cam specs are perfect for any capturing evey moments. 4k recording with 1080p and photos captured in low light are better.Macro photography and Warp30T do come in handy.Only difference with pro variant of 7T is u get a popup selfie and no other performance changes as the professor is same so if you can handle the notch then 7T is the best deal you can afford..The back design of pro variant 7/7T are very similar to redmi K20pro where as 7T looks like you got 3 big massive camera lenses and unique design adds fresh feel.Competitors like Redmi/Realme don't even match this beast. OnePlus is allrounder in this segnent.Try to get in exchange offer as that gets you the best price cut for a very premium device.,0,Best OnePlus yet - Flagship device of the year,5.0
Amit, 16 June 2020,Have been using since 8 months no complain till now.. earlier the apps used to close or crash the camera s/w did not respond which have been corrected in recent updates. I feel the fingerprint reader is a bit slow compared to other similarly priced phones. Bought this phone only for camera and it dnt dissapoint. Was about to get Iphone 11 but got this one instead.  Overall a good purchase.. did not dissapoint..,0,Best phone at 35-40k range,5.0
Amazon Customer, 21 October 2019,Just got my phone yesterday. The speaker quality is very poor. It has some technical issue with collection and transmission of sound. Tried it during several phone calls. When switched to headset Mose it works fine but on changing to loudspeaker each time there is a problem. Also when on headset mode the opposite person's voice can be heard by someone sitting away even with the lowest volume. No privacy of conversations!! Had oneplus3t earlier and thought of upgrading but very disappointed as the basic purpose of the phone is making calls and lots of inconvenience faced during the first day itself.,One,Speaker faulty,2.0
RB, 1 July 2020,So just received my Phone and surprise surprise..cant Set it Up because its already been Set Up for some other Gmail Account. So either User phones are being delivered as new ones or those Testing are forgetting to factory reset. One Plus what say? Spent a miserable day thinking Phone was faulty and then voila...recovery Mode and cleaning all Data and the Phone Set Up easily. Not Tried any Features yet...but this was definitely Not the experience I was looking for.,One,Used Phone or testers forget to reset?,1.0
Amazon Customer, 3 June 2020,This phone is ALL that you need! This is by far the best Android smartphone ever and packs powerful features at a good price. The camera foremost let's you capture stunning images has different focal lengths and has a fast capture rate. Simply amazing. The processor is fast and I mean FAST. The best thing about the phone is it's gaming mode and gaming graphics. Has Dolby Atmos sound which coupled with a high refresh rate delivers an enhanced gaming experience for games like NFS FIFA PubG etc. Also really good charging capacity and battery life. I really like the feel of the phone I got a blue one.Only con is that it doesn't include a headphone port for 3mm jacks. So one can either purchase a One plus connector or purchase a set of wireless headphones (which is what I did).,0,Best Android Smartphone Ever. Hands Down!,5.0
Mahesh Alhat, 17 January 2020,Fast processing fingerprint reader is very fast charging very fast and easily lasts for a day once full charged. Camera quality is best even my friends who are using I phone asks for taking photos. FB app is not working good. Found some software problem while using sometimes display automatically gets white patch i need to restart the device to solve this problem. I don't know whether this is happening with my phone only or others are also facing the same issue.Oneplus team should solve this issue asap.,One,OnePlus 7T Review,3.0
Basit, 9 November 2019,I've been using it for a while now. Absolutely f****ing glad i purchased this. It has its cons but whatever it does well it does mindblowingly well. So much here that has been done to perfection.Pros:1- Display is so good its unreal. After using 90hz you'll never want to go back to 60 hz again. Infact I find 60hz phones quite unusable now. Colors are awesome too. It's not curved like OnePlus 7 Pro so it doesn't have the issue of accidental touches and inputs from your palm that curved screens have. On top of that it won't break as easily and curved glass on any accidental falls and It'll also cost a LOT less if you happen to break it than a curved glass would.The brightness is excessive. To the point where there is no need to have it above 75% brightness in any situation even outdoors. This means even outdoors in sunlight you'll have a good viewing experience and STILL be below the maximum brightness possible in this phone.2- Camera is amazing. Macro shots and nightscape will blow your mind. Wide angle lens does a good job too.3- Oxygen OS is arguably the ONLY version of Android that is better than stock (it's debatable but I stand by this statement) . The OS is a huge selling point alone.4 - The charging again blows my mind. I usually don't charge overnight. I wake up keep it on charge till I take a shower and have my breakfast. When I'm back 45 mins later it's almost always fully charged. That is absolutely nuts.Cons:1- There is no headphone jack. Although you can buy an adapter for pretty cheap on the oneplus site itself. Still jumping a few extra hoops to use my Earphones is a con for sure. And Bluetooth Earphones just aren't on the same level as wired ones (audio output wise) unless you're willing to shell out upwards of 5k.2- Battery surely isn't nearly as bad as people in the comment section seem to be saying it is. But it's still pretty average. It'll last you the day but no more than that. This isn't that huge a con bexuase as I said battery isn't bad it's just not anything special. And secondly the warp charge can get half your battery back in 25 mins or so so the actual capacity means very little when you have that as far as real world usage is concerned.,0,A class above everything else.,5.0
Priya, 18 October 2019,Camera is hanging and not responding...initially we thought that we should check for some time before returning the product ...usually return window is opened for 10 days but for this item it has been delivered on 14th....after using 3-4 days issue is continued so we are thinking to make a replacement but found return window closed on 17th. Why return window was closed in just 3 -4 days.Front camera is frequently hanging...it is surprising that so much ram and processor is not able to Handel the hanging issue....please make a replacement for product.,One,Camera is not responding,3.0
VATSAVAYI BHARAT VARMA, 15 October 2019,This is the first phone that is giving me headaches just by looking at it! I mean did i get a defective piece or is OnePlus really that bad? I've seen someone in another review of the phone saying the same thing. How can a device like this move into production and then be sold. You're spreading out health problems via a phone. Don't tell me that I'm the only one with the problem. I've use LG Samsung and an Iphone and have never faced such an issue. My first purchase of Oneplus and will be my last. Should never have trusted in the first place.,One,HEADACHE!!,2.0
Pranav Bhargav, 5 November 2019,A wonderful upgrade for someone who are using phones like iPhone se/6/7 and one plus 5/5t. Earlier I was using an iPhone SE. I'm writing this review after one week of usage.Pros:• Battery life•Fast charging•flawless display•super fast processor•camera•great gaming performanceCons:• many times I faced software glitches in social media apps• Camera sucks in Snapchat (zoomed and very blurred image clarity by default)•im using a frosted silver model and I'm not really satisfied with the color which makes it look like an old fashioned phone.Verdict: Really good phone by one plus which offers you 90% of 7 pro features at 38k. I hope all the software glitches and Snapchat camera gets fixed after an update in future.if you're on an higher budget I would suggest you to buy Samsung Galaxy S10 or an iPhone 11 because both of them offer much better camera performance than one plus 7t.,0,Fast processor phone with few glitches,4.0
Nirupam Roy, 31 May 2020,Everything is good either its build quality or oxygen os expect front camera (good one but slightly soft picture) and battery (batery optimisation of oxygen os is the best amomg android but it's little less ~3800mah for a big gorgeous 90hz display). But if you carry a decent powerbank with you in outing then this the best phone within 35k till now.But what strikes the most is its perfomance it's seemless and buttery smooth even in 60hz refresh rate.Rest is up to you.,One,Best within 35k till now.,4.0
nishant tyagi, 20 May 2020,What else one could ask for. The Best phone in its category. Cheaper than Flagships. Camera is awesome. Few shortcomings but that's pertaining to Software and platform of the OS. But that's a point of comparision with other brands. The simplicity yet a powerful processing is its unique feature,One,Loving the One Plus,5.0

Anusha modi, 25 December 2019,It's been one month for this purchase and I'm still in love with this phone. Absolutely wonderful camera quality..the picture quality is superb. Amazing battery life despite of so much consumption through the day. I'm used to watching (streaming) a lot of videos and listen to music throughout the day plus the regular calls messaging and other data consumption doesn't exhaust the battery fully. I just charhe my phone once a day and it suffices me for more than 16 hours a day.,One,Happy with the purchase and love it!!,5.0
anshul, 10 November 2019,Everything is at its best except the 90hz screen won't give you 1day chargeAnd i don't know why but my phone laggs 1 out of 10times in the dialing and contact screensAnd last but the most annoying thing is  headphone jack!Believe me that jack connector has nothing more than just a connection extension with a little piece of wire but costs at least 300 rs and go upto 1500 also :D ..I personally bought an local one in 50 rs and it didn't work coz of different config so i cut opened it and resoldered it 🙃. Now its awesome!If headphone jack is so imp to you ? Then be ready to soen some extra cash of no worth 😒 .And one last thing if you are a fan of those oxygen os customizations like in phones like yuphoria  they don't give it now☹️ it's color os now and it's just okay okay.,0,I am stisfied with this but still think of k20 and X2 options.,5.0
Aditya, 4 November 2019,It lives up to the expectation screen flawless and smoother than every mobile phone in it's category. Fingerprint reader is faster than OnePlus 7. Wide angle camera is a major boost to the camera set up. Been using it for more than a month now seems like it's gonna last for a long time. Played asphalt and pubg no lagging  super smooth gaming experience. WARP charging is a boon charges fully in approximately 60 mins or less so no worries for the battery performance. Dual speaker set up adds to the gaming experience. Only drawback that I feel personally is the lack of 3.5 mm earphone jack.,0,Super smooth,4.0
Naveen.Bailkeri, 12 October 2019,Delivery experience: Amazon took 10days to deliver this  bad experience from Amazon delivery for the first time.Product review:1. Fluid and super fast software experience as expected from one plus oxygen os with Android 10.2. Battery life is decent with 90hz and amazing with 60hz mode . With normal usage easily lasts 1day with 90hz. Got more than 1 day with 60hz display mode.3. Charging is crazy fast. 30 minutes of charging for a day works for me.4. Camera quality is good and macro mode is fun to use. Camera bump is bit ugly though5. Sound quality is good and loud because of the dual front facing speakers.6. Onscreen fingerprint sensor is decently fast not as good as the actual sensor.7.  Display is great. Phone looks and feels premium in hand.8. No headphone jack.😟Overall a great phone.,One,Awesome and super fast phone,5.0

Buy it on its merit.,5.0
anindya, 4 December 2019,Love the 90hz display. And the cameras have also improved A Lot. Both daylight n night time pics come out great. Good viewing angles on the phone and the sound quality is also superb. Just wish the battery was a tiny bit larger since it runs out of juice by the end of the day with medium usage. Ofcourse warp charge 3T is great at recharging in about an hour still would have preferred a larger battery if only to avoid anxiety issues towards the end of the day. Overall the best package for the price when you compare both hardware n software. Do Remember to get the One year extended warranty from OnePlus free.,0,Premium Bargain,5.0
Gokul, 14 November 2019,I think OnePlus is one of the best phones i have used so far and come across. Coming to review of different aspects of 7T :Touch screen is awesome and cool - 5/5Size of the mobile is little large and somewhat heavy - 4/5Making of the mobile is too gud - 5/5Camera quality - 5/5Battery life not satisfied with as it lasts easily in one day with heavy usage - 3/5Battery charging using latest technology with fast charging  - 5/5Overall its 4/5 as i am not satisfied with the battery life but still its premium mobile with good features.,0,OnePlus 7T review after 1 month of use,4.0
Thouseef, 20 December 2019,First thing come mind for OnePlus 7t is 90hz display absolutely fantastic and 2 things powerful processer and finger print sensor very smooth and other little it's very attractive and wrap chargerCons. Batter life it's not up to mark 3800 mAh might little higher,One,Geart device go for it,5.0
Shreyas Bathe, 13 October 2019,This phone is just awesome. No wonder why OnePlus is gaining popularity so fast. I've to say this is the best phone I've had till now. The camera is just amazing...one which can compete with all the top level flagships like the iPhone X/11 the Samsaung Galaxy S10 and Pixel. Low light photography without using nightsight is itself really good..with nightsight the photos just get thrown at the top end of the spectrum. 90Hz display is out of this world..very smooth experience. RAM management too is done very nicely. The display is awesome. Battery life might seem less for such a powerful phone...but believe me it's a complete beast. I'm easily getting 8-8.5 hours of on screen time..and warp charge just charges the phone to 100% in under an hour. The haptic feedback is really good and software experience is top-notch. Just go for it without giving a second thought.,0,A BEAST FROM ONEPLUS!!,5.0

Arshad Sherasiya, 9 October 2019,All over a very good phone.Pros :Smoothest and brightest display in its segmentFastest and buttery smooth UI experienceCamera is near flagship. Don't expect quality like Samsung's or apples' flagships.Only one con :I am skeptical about battery life down the line. Currently I am getting one day battery life with screen on time of hardly 5 hours. It will reduce overtime which makes me worried.,One,90 Hz display is awesome but drains lot of battery,5.0
Sarjan, 27 May 2020,Lighting Fast Mobile with Punchy and vivid AMOLED screen and a very good triple camera setup... Previously I was a Samsung fan had used Galaxy S6  S7 and my last device was S8 but after using OnePlus 7T for few days I am convinced that OnePlus have made an awesome phone with long lasting battery life an awesome Camera and unbelievably impressive 90Hz AMOLED screen and tremendously smooth Snapdragon 855+ processor...I belive this is definitely the most intriguing device launched so far by OnePlus.,One,A Genuine Premium Flagship Phone...!!!,5.0
Abhilash M., 24 December 2019,Awesome phone in this price rangefully loaded both software and hardware wise..The 90Hz screen refresh rate although consumes battery but gives you an in-depth picture quality... The camera quality is superb with the Sony Lens capturing every detail..and then there's the Wide Angle view too.. The Nightscape mode feels like clicking a picture and watching a good quality edited Wallpaper... The Battery life could have been worked upon but can live with...The Fingerprint reader is quite swift and secure..The Little things that make the Huge Difference like the Slider Bar... quite handy for office goers who forget to Silent their phones...The Oxygen OS is quite user friendly and interactive... Overall the Snapdragon 855+ processor coupled with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB Rom..packs a Power House!!,0,Power House!!,5.0
sangeeth k., 9 January 2020,Camera performance at Low light and nightscape isn't good enough for a mobile at this price range. The battery is just average it depends on your usage. I got 6.5hr of sot even at 90hz refreshrate i have attached the screenshots of the app i used.EDITED : after 10 days of usage i found an issue with the battery. It drains 9-10% overnight when the mobile is idle. I'm trying to replace this device will let you guys know in few days. OnePlus 7t really sucks.,One,OnePlus 7t sucks.,2.0
Anbu, 3 October 2019,In simple it's the most affordable premium phone that can compete with the likes of iPhone 11 and Samsung S10.I have been using OnePlus 3 from the day it's released. Its been 3 years 4 months and I have never faced any issues. That's why I love OnePlus.Now I have upgraded to OnePlus 7T and below is my feedbackPros:Performance - No lag very fastCamera - Works in low light as wellDisplay - 90hz displayPriceCons:Should have included headphone dongle in the boxNo wireless chargeSometimes phone overheatsFeels little big and heavyConsidering price difference between other premium phones and OnePlus 7T.

Simranjeet Singh, 2 November 2019,It is really a great phone and worth all your money indeed. Camera is really great but saturation is bit high at times. Battery life not so great but it will last you decent 12hrs depending upon your usage but yes the charger is the greatest asset of this phone. In no time it will charge but you need to carry it everywhere. Overall it's a powerful phone at a decent price. Specs are top of the line without getting into details. 7T has really great specs and superb camera but do not buy OnePlus 7 it doesn't have many features and specs.

Tushar Patel, 7 June 2020,OnePlus 7T has awesome look and performance. Battery life is ok average Not too good and not too bad. You will get the updates timely. Camera quality is decent in indoor and excellent in outdoor condition but little sluggish while taking pictures so when you click pictures of your kids it becomes blurry. Otherwise all good. Camera is better than other smart phone who are close to 20k or 25k. You need to set yourself on camera to get better quality. You will never complain about performance however I will recommend to switch off and switch on once a day for better and consistent performance. Don't use other charger to charge as they are slow and sometimes heat up your phone and can damage. Game performance is also good. Observed normal heating while Pubg which is normal.,0,Good Phone. You will not regret.,4.0
Amazon Customer, 17 November 2019,It's an amazing phone much faster the camera quality is good lighter the sound quality is excellent. However I am finding some problems with the wats app on this phone. After a month or so I face trouble handling this app it keeps hanging. Every time I restart my device to make it work I am not sure that is it happening due to a problem with the app or with the device. Otherwise the phone is a must buy.,One,phone is worth buying,5.0
rounak, 8 March 2020,Pros :1) Great Battery Life and optimization. It can last for 1 day completely even under heavy usages.(pubg YouTube videos  music) For Normal usage it can go on for around 2 days.2) Super fast charger. One of the selling point of one plus phones. It juice up the phone form 50% to 100% in mere 30 mins.3) Super smooth display. With 90hz refresh rate you can really see the difference while scrolling through the insta and Facebook pages. It's fast and smooth. I didn't see any significant Battery issues due to 90hz refresh rate so far.4) Camera : great pictures in lightning conditions.5) Last But not the least is Oxygen OS.  4.1) Frequent Updates.  4.2) Cool features. I personally like those customize layout. I am using dark layout with red theme. It looks amazing.Cons :1)Finger print reader. It like on/off sort of situation sometime it work and sometimes it doesn't. May be some software glitch I guess.2) camera performance under dark conditions is above average. Photos looks are on softer side.3) Google keyboard flickering issue in dark mode I am not sure about its related to Google keyboard itself or its software glitch in one plus.4) Heating issue you can feel it around the camera bump.  if you play pubg for around 2 hr or more. But that is acceptable I assume most phones heats up.,0,One plus 7T Review (After 1 Month of usage),4.0
Vamsi Krishna Kala, 27 June 2020,I just wanted a phone for a longer period than my normal which would last for a year or so and due to my usage they will not work after that. But this is seriously a piece of art even though I put it on very tough times it easily handles the work load and does not lag. And coming about the camera it is wonderful but the only thing is it produces a bit of artificial colours which makes image obviously artificial. Except that this is phone is awesome 😁.👍 Great work #OnePlus team,One,Perfect phone for people whose phones get damaged after one year of usai,5.0
Cheryl, 8 February 2020,Purchased it in December 2019. Very happy with it. A major upgrade from my previous phone the OnePlus 3T. The camera quality is really great.

Amazon Customer, 19 December 2019,Actually it was really better for me to buy OP7T after using OP3 for 3 years. I wanted to go for Vivo 17 Pro and iPhone 11 and Vivo was not as good as OP at Camera processor and all and iPhone is costly for me.Coming to OP7T Pro edition I found that it was only about curved screen so there was no point I could spend 14 k extra for that.In the end I think I had a very very genuine purchase and I am blessed to use it for next 3 years.,One,Awesome purchase,5.0

Ajesh Joseph, 16 November 2019,The phone was good for 1.5 week after that I started seeing many issues.1. Fingerprint Scanner is too confused many times it wont read2.

Fingerprint Scanner keeps scanning and hangs it wont provide Pin entry and then Shows a Pink circle on the scanner area with the background image.4. While Taking picture Camera hangs photo is displayed on the screen but no saved to library. In certain cases the screen freezes with the picture and take 30 sec to get back to normalcy.

rahul maithani, 21 December 2019,Amazing phone in this price range. OP always does better job and gives head to head competition to flagship phones. No words to say further as u huys already have seen the vedios related to it.The fingerprint is very fastcamera is top notch having a 90 Hz display the battery life chould have been better if it has a 4500 mAH battery. But 3800 mAH does the job pretty wellplus it is supported by 30T warp chargerso it's not an issue.The power pack performer 855+ is therewith UFS 3.0 so don't think it will have any performance issues.The design and build quality is amazing but should have to use the case for ur own security.And also to mention the delivery by Amazon.

Viraj K, 2 June 2020,I've been using this phone since a long time now and I must say OnePlus has made it flawlessly amazing... Indeed the On-screen Fingerprint works faster than previous devices and there's no doubt battery life too deserves 5 Stars the only thing I must say regarding this phone is some comments on Camera... Camera no doubts is super amazing but outof 100 I would rate this camera as 95 because once you try to focus on an object the side of image gets little out of focus and give a Ray apperance.. maybe I can't describe in words but you'll find many videos regarding that..  but overallScreen 6/5 (Flawless)Camera 4.5/5Battery 4.99/5 (Its totally Subjective)Dash Charge 5/5 (No doubts)On-screen Fingerprint 4.9/5 (Dont ask its still the fastest but can be rated 5/5)Gaming experience 6/5 (I mean it)Fluency 4.99/5 (It improves everytime there's software update and you'll find it in any other device. As compared to any other phone its still maintaining its repute)Personalization 5/5,0,Overall this device is Best and Affordable,5.0
Priyesh Nagdeote, 28 June 2020,Software is very smooth . Stereo speakers delivers good sound but not better than iphone 11 . Face unlock is very fast . Charging is extremely fast . No headphone jack for which you will have to get a 3.5mm connector( around 400Rs ) or a pair of bluetooth earphones . Touch responses are very good . If you are buying it then do check the backlight glitch issue  as there are some customers which faced it and requested a replacement . In my device luckily backlight issue was not there . It happens very rare so don't worry . Haptic motor gives very nice vibrations while typing . Cameras are good but not great than Samsung's or Apple's competitors. Colours look very saturated but you have the option to calibrate the screen according to your preference . 90hz works very well while using heavy softwares or multiple tabs or even intensive gaming . Overall phone is very good and worthy at 35k budget . I don't think the new oneplus nord/x will be better deal than this  let's see . If you have little low budget than it is worth waiting for upcoming X/ Nord .,0,Good deal  Go for it !,4.0
Pooja G., 13 October 2019,Best phone in market now for this price range with the specs that OnePlus is providing  however I am still unable to identify the advantages of warp change over the dash charging of my old 1+5 pretty much on the same lines.Got the product delived on time by Darshita electronics would recommed the seller for this phone.However I bought my phone durign the Duseehera sale  and the prices now are even lower credits to the bank offers.🙃,0,Best buy for the price range and spec details.,5.0

Rohit J, 8 February 2020,Overall impressions of this phone is really good expect this phone to perform buttery smooth and insanely fast. But I found some things really disappointing.1. Battery- Though the battery is a 3800 mAh (li-ion) battery it isn't sufficient (lasts roughly up to 4-6hrs of usage. Plus there is slight heating issue temperature rises all the way up to 42°C and an average of (37-39°C) that's kind of a heating issue for me. OnePlus could've used the traditional li-po batteries providing a range between 5000-6000 mAh battery capacity just like Asus ROG did so that the temperature remains constant.2. Camera bump - the slight camera bump in the back also kind of annoys me because I feel it might get scratched even if I use it with the hard/bumper case.Other than that I really LOVE the phone especially the 90hz refresh rate at this price point is super cool plus OnePlus now are considering to improve their camera through software updates and it keeps getting better :)Thank you OnePlus and Amazon ;),0,Best of flagship,5.0
Vigneshwaraa, 14 November 2019,Best budget flagship.Camera:-The details are great. The night mode is epic.The macro shot is great to take very small objects with great details. High Dynamic ratios are good.The super stability mode helps to record a shake free video when walking running or in a vehicle.Display:-Fluid amoled display with 90hz refresh rate is buttery-smooth. The 2400x1080 is great to watch movies and play games. The notch size is reduced which doesn't be a disturbance while watching movies or playing games.Hardware:-Snapdragon 855+ 8gb ram dolby atmos stereo speakers gives you the best gaming experience.The stereo speakers are really loud and clear.128gb UFS 3.0 is enough for most of the users.Battery:-The battery life is little bit less for power users but for an average user it stays for a day.The screen on time will be 6-7hrs when used for intense gaming and social media apps.The 30W wrap charge is really fast that saves a lot of time in charging. 30min of charge one full day battery for average users.Security:-The face ID is very fast that opens instantaneously.The in-display fingerprint scanner is also very fast.,0,Best budget flagship,5.0
shivam gupta, 25 October 2019,Hi Folks this is no doubt a good phone. Its snappy fast and swift at handling everyday activities.There are 2 issues though.1. Camera blur control! That is simply not available! Oxygen OS should include that. Gcam helps but thats about it.2.sound clarity over Bluetooth! Don't get me wrong!Its loud! Its really really good and music is ok. However bass that deep bass is not good and vocals are not clear. On Spotify you may get a better experience but on gana its poor.There is something to do with Dolby that you cannot switch off! I am using ath sr30 bt from audio Technica and Mi phones have better sound over Bluetooth!So those are the cons! The fact that it shattered on the bend test is also something one needs to take into account! The massive cutout for the camera us a design flaw Making the glass weak which breaks it!If you can handle it and no blur control is no problem like the kind of sound it produces...then go for it!Everything else is superb!,0,Everything else is superb!

Venkatesh, 4 March 2020,The built quality is very premium. The 90hz display gives a very smooth touch experience. Wap charge provides really amazing fast charging. The device gets charged 70% in 30 minutes.  Oneplus is providing 1 year extended warranty if you join the red cable club along with 50gb cloud storage for one year. No hanging; No heating issues. The oxygen OS also has a very premium look you can customize it.  They are not including any unnecessary (bloatware) software. The only headphone jack is missing.,0,Excellent.

Mahesh Kumar, 30 October 2019,Over the last 15 years of using phones I have spent a good part of my last decade- life & earnings on IPhones.  Except for Iphone 5 I’ve had all models until my last one which was the Iphone 8plus.  There was a brief period when Samsung (S6) grabbed my attention and it served me well however the bloatware got the best of me before I switched back to IOS.Iphone 8 Plus was with me for over 18 months and the charm had worn off-  it had started slowing down to a point where one could really notice it.  I know  change the battery do a factory reset & get another 18 months out of it but I was just too lazy to do all of that. Spending lots of money on a new Iphone when there was nothing new on offer did not make sense for me.  Specifically the option of only face unlock and even worse was the speed of unlocking the phone.  After playing around from various phones within friends & family:Enter One plus 7T-Pros:- Premium build & exudes quality.  I got the Blue version- Charging speed-  It’s a miracle!!  ~30% to 100% by the time I finish my shower & breakfast- Speed-  Multi tasking is a joy  never had a single instance of phone hanging or an app crashing (Side note- Android apps have really become stable from 5 years ago)- Screen is really impressive- Bright vivid & I love the color saturation (this is a personal choice)- Dual sim-  now I carry just one phone- Connectivity- Wifi & Mobile Network are better than I experienced on my older 8Plus- Camera-  Debatable they are not the best nor the worst.  Colors can appear unnatural at times.  I prefer Iphone 11 on this one but much better than Samsung S9 or older Iphones- Customization options are unlimited-  Fancy for me-  In screen Fingerprint scanner - as fast as any normal oneCons:- Battery-  Let’s be clear.  I am a heavy user with office mails synced on phone.  This lasts the work day but I won’t be confident to go out for tipple after work without a short boost.  But this was the case with my 8 Plus too except I now need just 15 mins to charge and not an hour like before.  Not a deal breaker for me- Battery-  Update after few days of usage.  Switch to 60hz display turn off wifi/BT when not in use and it actually lasts much longer.  But 60Hz is not fun once you have used 90Hz- No 3.5 mm but they could’ve given the convertor- It’s a pain to get tempered glass or back cover from local shops.  Guess this will change soon with more phones coming to the market,0,IOS to Oxygen- Breathe of life,5.0
SHAILESH SONAR, 14 March 2020,Have purchased above phone and got delivery of the same on 20 th Jan 2020. It worked well for less than 2 months and screen gone blank totally. Customer Service of One Plus over phone could not solve and he asked to visit service station. After spending huge money DO I supposed to spend time money and energy to visit service station and get it repaired??

Sachin Patil, 17 December 2019,Battery Life sucks You hardly get 7 hours of usage. But charging speed is better so you can survive a little bit.Low light camera especially Night mode should have been much better with Triple camera set up but it is a big disappointment.In display fingerprint reader is awesome so is the refresh rate but again battery drains a lot if you keep at 90 Hz  so it's enough with 60 Hz ..Ram performance is not upto the mark.Price pont of view it's value for your money.But improvement needed like inbuilt features for Photo and Video editing would have been nice.Camera design not many people are happy with it.Infrared feature is missing so you cannot use it as a remote.,0,Value for your Money.

Mehul, 3 October 2019,It looks good feels good (thanks to the metallic back - I hate fingerprints) and sounds good (thanks to Dolby Atmos). My first experience with a OnePlus phone and to say that I am extremely pleased with my purchase would be an understatement.Speed is also extremely high and the display along with other features make it a joy to use. I find myself looking for excuses to look at it/use it while I'm at work and I'm fighting a losing battle in that aspect. I've accepted it.I only wish there were better cases for the phone as the transparent one provided with the packaging looks cheap. I mean it does the job of course but I would've loved if the phone came with the carbon fibre bumper case instead; as it just looks too good. That or the red one would've been great.,0,"When they said ""Smooth Like Never Before"" I didn't know it was THIS smooth",5.0
Mukund Joshi, 6 July 2020,This smartphone really pleases the eye with its huge screen and excellent display. And it feels fast and fluid too. So everything is there what I would expect from a flagship device in 2019. Two tings I really like on this phone: 1. The parallel apps: I tried it with Twitter and I could set up another Twitter with a different account. Very usefull feature indeed. Unfortunately only some apps are supported: Instagram Telegram WhatsApp and Twitter (at least only those apps show up in the list of supported apps on my device). 2. Secret drawer in Oneplus launcher. Very handy for hiding certain apps from preying eyes. In my case I put in there all the system apps I can't disable or uninstall :-) But Oneplus 7T is not perfect. There are some annoyances too: 1. The glass back is slippery so it needs a case on. But the case creates gesture navigation issues: swiping from the bottom screen edge becomes hit and miss because of the elevated case edge which obstructs touches in that particular navigation area. 2. The fingerprint reader is too far down for the thumb ro teach. Pushing the thumb further down you risk the phone slipping out of your palm. A higher position would have been better. 3. It happens quite often that because of the thin bezels my palm touches the screen unintentionally and triggers something which annoys a lot. Typing while holding it is sometimes a challenge (I guess this is an issue with all those thin bezels smartphones). So to make it user-friendly I wish my next phone have thicker bezels please. 4. The phone implements a gesture navigation where swiping from the left or right edges of the screen the previous or the next screen will open. That creates problem when swype-typing words that start with the letters on the far left and right end. It happens often that when I swype-type the words that starts with p the keyboard disappears instead of writing the word on the screen.,0,Excellent phone with some annoyances,4.0
Ida Vaz, 16 October 2019,My review after one week of use of OnePlus 7T1. DISPLAY & BUILD QUALITY-Superb AMOLED screen which is very bright good in sunlight too-90HZ refresh rate is an added bonus. -If you don't mind that notch all else is good.- The form factor is compact and small making it easy to hold and operate with one hand.-No Always On display option and No LED notification light.  -The front and back of phone is thankfully not a fingerprint magnet but attracts lots of dust.-Overall design of the phone is very good except for the camera bump. But the front of the phone looks similar to every other cheap notch-wala phones in the market.-I wish there was water and dust resistance IP rating. -No headphone jack and no earphones in the package. Atleast a 3.5mm converter should be included in the package.-No IR Blaster.2. OPERATING SYSTEM-Latest Oxygen OS 10 and Android 10.... best in class.-OS has lot of customization and is very fluid and easy to use. - Does not come with much bloatware and unwanted apps can be uninstalled.3. CAMERA QUALITY-Both cameras of this phone are really good for daytime.-Low light pics and nightscape mode are hopeless.-Picture processing takes a bit long especially during night time.-Major problem is the Portrait Mode which doesn't work properly. I don't see much background blurred. -Wide-angle shots and Macro shots are good.-I don't like the camera bump but with the cover on it is not a hindrance.-Some more functionalities and settings in the camera are missing.4.  BATTERY LIFE-3800 MAH battery is quite adequate for about 7 hours of screen time.-The 30T warp charger makes up for the battery issue to some extent as charging happens super quick.-Battery drains faster at 90Hz refresh rate so i changed it to 60Hz as I am not a gamer.-I found no heating issues with this phone but gamers or heavy users can tell about that.5. SECURITY-Face unlock and On-screen fingerprint reader are amazingly fast and it unlocks the phone at the blink of an eye.-The best part is the screen lights up at night so face unlock works like a charm even in a dark room. -Technology here is unmatched flagship quality but I find the face unlock unreliable as it recognizes my face in the mirror too and unlocks it.POINTERS FOR AMAZON1. Provided me one day delivery for FREE.... thanks Amazon.2. Proper invoice not provided in package or in email.3. Bank offers and discounts made it a sweet deal.POINTS FOR ONEPLUS1. Amazing upgrade to the OnePlus 7 phone but customers of previous iterations will be disappointed for not waiting for the best model.2. Free two year warranty on phone if you register with OnePlus Care App.3. Very nice quality phone back cover provided in the package.,0,Amazingly Fast Super Phone.,4.0
Amazon Customer, 11 October 2019,Product is being sold with broken seal.  Product's accessories may be copy or duplicate.. specially when u r in delhi..,4,Broken seal..,1.0
aatif, 2 June 2020,Bought this beast 4 days back that is on 30th of May 2020. Yes this beast gives complex to many 2020 new flagships.Pros:1. Excellent build quality which feels premium to hold and looks classy2. Display quality is top notch in this segment3. Blazing fast processor. There is no lag whatsoever.4. OXygen OS is selling point for One plus devices and rightly so. Such smooth and lovely gestures and clean UI.5. GCam works fine. Stock camera is goo too. I can say that it's not great but good enough to do your job.6. 30watt charger is ice on cake. It makes your task super easy.7. Face unlock in this device has become super fast with new updates. Works amazingly. No complaints. Even in zero light it works perfectly.Cons:1. Battery life is not that great. Mild uses can last you full day.2. Camera could be improved with software updates. 48 megapixel camera doesn't shoot automatically but you need to go to Pro mode for that.3. Some issues with YouTube videos. Sometimes it doesn't pinch to zoom. But I am sure it would be corrected with some updates.I couldn't find much cons for now. I am still searching for it.My verdict: Instead of going for one plus 8 which is 8K costlier go for this device. It gives you extra 2GB of RAM. Camera is same in both the devices.For those who are thinking to go with other brands in this range just don't. Once try out Oxygen OS and you would fall in love.I shifted from Nokia 6.1 plus and this device is like rocket fast for me.I am loving it.,0,Perfect for even 2020,5.0
Amazon Customer, 9 November 2019,Best phone  it's quite remarkable how smooth and easy this phone operates I've used it for now more than a month and still no lag  no performance issues  now I have become  use to of the gestures by oneplus. Be it the camera department  the smoothness  the speed and performance of course the 90 hz display is a real thing and you know what  you will feel major difference when using other devices . A bit improvement is needed in battery department but OnePlus has covered it by giving fast charging which is blazing fast however you can easily run this phone for one whole day if you are a moderate user  say 2-3 hrs of watching videos  answering calls taking photos  etc. I am very satisfied with the product. Moreover I've purchased the 128 gb variant which at that time was of 38000 got 2000 instant discount and exchanged my old phone for 3250 and got it at no cost emi so it was nice deal.,0,OMG this phone really is a beast !!,5.0
Divij, 20 November 2019,Amazing and a power full phone. Camera quality is great low light photography is also very good. Battery life is decent and depends on your usage. Performance wise simply outstanding. The face detection is so quick that you will not realise how fast the phone unlocks. The on screen fingerprint reader is also pretty good and quick. But the face detection response time beats everything. Using this phone from about more than a month and very happy to have chosen one plus 7t.,One,Simply awesome phone,5.0
Vishal, 28 December 2019,Surprised at fingerprint unlock speed!Camera: Camera is good but leaves you wanting for more!At this price point they should move beyond IMX586 which is available even in 10k phones.Navigation: dual GPS and fast processor together comes in handy to figure directions quickly. Volume rocker slider is useless they can get rid of it.,0,Good camera and fast unlock,5.0
Swathi, 9 October 2019,The camera is not even 16 MP  but one plus 7T claiming 48MP. Camera quality very bad.  Images are very poor in resolution. And gets detoriate if we zoom only 1x time. Pixels is very less and poor images in day light..,3,Dont buy for camera expectation One plus 7T,2.0
Chetan, 25 October 2019,My honest rating for this phone is 3.5The reason why I'm giving 3.5 is even though it has all best specification you can get like camera8gb ram855+ SD processor it's  only disadvantage is it has only 3800mah battery which means hardly one day or one full charge it will last long till night to utilize full specification of this phone u need better battery lifeplayed pubg for exactly 80 mins battery gone from 85% to 26%also has little bit of heating issue,One,3.5 rating,3.0

Sanketik Pradhan, 23 December 2019,I am giving this review after using my Oneplus 7T for about 15 days. Since now I have not faced any lag issue or app crashing issue. Below are some detailed features I want to mention.#OxygenOS and Fnatic mode : The main advantage of this phone is smoother experience with the 90hz display and Oxygen OS. It runs on the latest Android 10 version. The Gaming mode and the special Fnatic mode is very useful for me. It activats advanced DND mode and blocks calls notifications messages and enhances the RAM   CPU and GPU and also enhances the network speed.#Battery life:The bettery life is not that bad or good but average. For me as a student it lasts about oneday for a single charge . I can play a full game of PUBG mobile on this divice and it drains only 12-16% battery . But the charging speed with the Wrap 30T is insanely fast. It almost charges my phone from 15% to 80-85% in almost half an hour. If you continuously watch youtube videos  it will give you about 7-8 hour of backup in 90hz  which is great I think. If you want more battery backup you can use it in 60hz.#Camera quality:I don't think i need to say about that. You can check the photos i have taken . The low light mode is awesome.. And a super awesome feature is the supermacro mode. It can focus objects near to the camera of about 2-3 cms. The pro mode is really awesome which allows you to shoot photos in different ways. I have to still explore the various camera mode options 😅😅. Many people don't like the camera bump and the round camera design. I was also one of them but after using for 5-7 days I am used to it and now I don't feel bad about it.#Sound quality:Sound quality is also good compared to the previous edition (OP 6) of my friend. Now it comes with dynamic sound quality with Dolby Atmos.#Warrenty and updates:Oneplus gives android updates for about 2 years and security patch updates for 3 years . I have got 1 year warrenty . Then i got complementary 1 year warrenty extension by downloading OnePlus care app and registering my IMEI ID no. Overall I got 2 years of warrenty.,0,My experience after using for 15 days .,5.0
darshan jadhav, 8 December 2019,Review after 2 months of use.What a product delivered by OnePlus truly value for your every penny.Awesome camera with top notch Macro mode.Standby battery life is now improved after recent update.Screen is really butter with 90hz.CPU Performance is flawless played Asphalt 9 call of duty mortal Kombat at a time still running smoothly without heating.Go for it guys!!!,0,Speechless!!!,5.0
Mathews G., 16 February 2020,The phone is a great buy for the price.A Flagship killer indeed. Been using it for 4 days. Let me sum up what this phone offered me within this short span of days.1.Speed(snapdragon 855+ and 90hzit flows... literally)2.Oxygen OS (feels better than Android One if you ask me)3.Warpcharge 30T (0 to 70-80% in 30 mins) compensates for the lower battery.4.The display.(Pretty nice)Some of what i didn't like1.Oversaturated pictures under very bright conditionstaken from camera.Oneplus should enable more picture tweak options in camera settings to compensate for such issues.2.No 960 fps(OP did say it will be released later in an update but the lack of it was a bummer for me)3.The camera bump is not safe even with a case with raised camera lip.The camera circle concerns me when I am holding the phone since there is a chance of the lens getting dirty.,0,There isn't a better practical premium phone at this price point.,5.0
Pritam Dutta, 13 June 2020,I'm using it for 25 days.I will talk about its pros and cons.Cons:1. Less battery life than other ships out there...2. Has problem with low light photography.3. Get heats a bit sometimes...but not all the time.4. In hand feel is good but feels a little havier.Pros:1. The best processor in 35k. 👌2. The best camera👌3. In low light it takes the best photo using the flash 👌4. The Macro lens is a killer !!! The best ever 👌5. Battery performance is decent. If you play games all the time it will still give you a life of 4-5 hours. But in decent daily life use you will deffinately get a battery life of 10-12 hours 👍6. 90 Hz display with 855+ processor is a deadly combination for the smoothest feel while using.7. 30W Warp charger is a beast !!! Charges 50% in just 15-18 minutes!!! 😮So above all the numbers I would like to say that in this prize range Oneplus 7T is the best phone.You might think that 3800 battery won't last long but I gurantee that with normal daily use you will able to get an all day battery life for sure.Go for it choose this flagship among all the ships out there a d tou'll realise that its better than a lot of them.I've shared some of my captures in normal and macro lenses  check them out.,0,The Best !!!,5.0
Aastha Agarwal, 11 December 2019,This phone is amazing. The look the feel the standard. OnePlus never fails to surprise with new features with every model they make. And nither has this one. Amazing gestures with a very new way to navigate in n out of a window this phone is amazing. With the large screen its an all new experience while reading.All in all an awesome phone and ITS MADE IN INDIA ❤️,0,OnePlus never disappoints,5.0
D_Kumawat, 25 January 2020,Review after using 1+ 7T for 3 months. It’s camera quality is not good enough specially rear camera. finger print reader is also not up to the mark. It is not as expected from one plus in premium category phone 📱. Think before investing huge amount to buy this not so good piece from 1+.,2,Think twice before buying it,3.0
Harshal Chaudhari, 23 October 2019,Coming to the mobile the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is not good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.5/5BATTERY- 2.5/5Display - 4.8/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 5/5 Pro Camera performance looks. Cons Battery drain and heating up issues.,One,Camera is Awesome but battery backup is waste.,4.0
Surajit Chatterjee, 8 June 2020,Its been over a month since I've been using this device. My previous phone was oppo f5 and as compared to my previous phone the performance of OnePlus 7t is at par from my previous phone. I'll better list the pros and cons.Pros:1. Warp charger is terrific with accelerated charging in very less time.2. Amazing camera but few images that I captured in low light missed details and I'd say that's considerable.3. Sleek design and quite handy.4. Powerful battery.5. Perfect for Pubg Mobile 👌6. Fluid display is awesome.Cons:1. Needs a lot of updates as there are lot of bugs that could mess up with the security features.2. The built is pretty much delicate and couldn't stand drop tests as what I followed in the YouTube videos.3. I particularly faced an issue with Google Chrome in this device. After it hanged as many as 5 to 10 times while using Chrome I had raised the issue in the OnePlus community and no advances have been made so far.Edit after usage of 1 month. There are few feedbacks:1. I usually hear a weird sound of keypad (like the one that you listen on dialpad) even if I'm not using my phone. This happens quite often and the phone wakes up on its own.2. There's is an issue with my google chrome. Sometimes it doesn't refresh at all the page gets stuck until I close and reopen it again. It actually gets redirected in the background but not on the foreground while I'm on the page. This goes off when I reopen the app.3. Few patches need to be deployed for camera too. I experienced twice that my camera got stuck while using it.,0,Awesome device with few patched needed for bug fixing,4.0
Sai, 25 June 2020,Dont ever buy it in return and exchange this amazon will sell u defective product in return and exchange ur phn will get heated up tomuch wen u purchase in return and exchange unfortunately i found this one day later return and exchangeNote: pubg players dont order it on return and exchange amazonwill definitely send u defective one which was returned in past,One,Dont buy in return and exchange,1.0
VimalRaj, 7 July 2020,Review after using it for 4 months:Pros:1. Display Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome.2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855+ show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! is simply awesome it charging the device within an hour.5. Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS 4k 60 fps without EIS.6. Cam2api enabled.Cons:1. No type-C to 3.5 jack in box where it was available with 6T model.2. Battery Backup is not that good but doesnt matter it has fast charging.3. It's Bulky in hand4. Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.,0,True Flagship!!!,5.0
Kaushik Sarkar, 8 December 2019,Bought this phone as an upgrade to my iphone 6s and have used it for 2 full months now. And I am thoroughly dissapointed. It might be that the unit I got has issues but thats not going to stop me from writing a review.1. Phone & applications hang/freeze anytime - have to restart it again to continue smooth performance.2. Average camera performance. Night mode is great. But the camera never focuses accurately whenever I switch from wide angle to normal or even macro. Under normal lighting conditions the primary camera performs well.3. Battery drains quite quicker than expected but yeah thanks to warp charge. 40 minutes and I am back to 100% from 5%.4. Call quality is not up to the mark as the audio is extremely low in terms of volume.5. Stereo speakers are very loud and that's a plus point. However there is inconsistent sound distribution through earphones (I have tried many earphones on this and the observation is constant)OVERALL extremely disappointed with the phone's camera performance of applications &,0,Expected a lot than what I m getting,4.0
Rainy Yumkhaibam, 14 March 2020,I'll go with what i find it disappointing:# Average battery life.. that is obvious with what it comes with i.e 3800 mah. The fast charging makes up for it. So it's not a problem.# Heating issue with Mobile legend.. i dont play those graphic intensive games like COD or Pubg but heating up while playing ml i can't imagine playing those other games.. so often times i'd quit playing ml after 1 or 2 games bcoz of heating issue.# The stock camera: over saturated colours.. the 42 MP main lens is good it's clear but the software processing isn't good enough.. HDR has improved a lot but not an Iphone level HDR.,0,Overall Good @ this price,4.0
Amit Nagpal, 19 October 2019,Everything is great and exactly as claimed just one thing I miss is Notification light. (Might be a point of concern for few)Camera quality is superb specially Super Macro Mode and its Night mode do fab job.Screen is great and super responsive to feather touchBattery life is good with extreme fast charging (Wrap) noticeably faster than Dash Charging.Hope one glitch will be rectified in next update i.e. Some time it stays dumb- no sound or screen notification on receiving a whatsapp message or mail,One,Superb camera screen & Battery life,5.0

Pranjal Das , 25 December 2019,I am writing this review after a month of purchasing this device.1. The cameras are good but not great as Apple or Samsung. Well at this price this is better than any other phone.2. Performance - Do I even need to say about the performance? Lol3. Battery - Not great but not bad. Lasts 6hrs a day on heavy medium(my type of usage incl. Gaming YouTube). But on medium usage can last upto 13 to 15 hrs. Usage may vary*. But thanks to warp charge 30t this beast can charge from 0-70 in 30mins. So that's a major go...4. Display is too good.. that 90Hz redress rate is ming boggling.5. Design wise 7t is a beautiful smartphone. I don't mind the big camera bump. But I would recommend using a case as the phone is way too slippery.This phone has everything I want from a smartphone and I would recommend it to anyone who have a budget of 35000.I only have a small issue comming from a Samsung phone with One Ui is that I really miss that one handed mode. That is the only disappointment and yes also no headphone jack.,0,Best Smartphone for 35000,5.0
Dr Jayati Kumar, 30 October 2019,The best in the market till date I'm highly satisfied after almost one month usage.It has the best processing skills best camera giving excellent shots in day and night and excellent software.I didn't have any problem at all though a lot of people have told about battery draining fast but one thing needs to be mentioned that the battery gets charged very quickly too...You don't need to wait a lot.Overall I'm really going with the phone one plus 7 pro was an warning for me and thank God I waited for this one..😊,One,The best from one plus...😊,5.0
Mahy, 15 October 2019,An awesome product from OnePlus its face unlock is ultra fast and cam is just mind blowing...Guys buy this smartphone if you are a hardcore gamer and this is a gaming beast  battery life is excellent!!! One of the greatest thing is that OnePlus care for their users with updates!!(full HD display is also excellent I have compared it with Samsung note10plus Guys believe me 7T beats note10plus's qhd+1440p and I'm happy that I saved 40k 🥰🤗.,0,Mind blowing performance,5.0
Hema Shetty , 25 November 2019,Oneplus has nailed it with specs they always had a great software the camera does it's job very well. Plus a fast charger is a bonus. The only disappointment was the battery life. For heavy users you need to charge at least twice a day for normal usage it will last a full day. One other small issue is the camera bump- not sure why they designed the cameras in the circular module. If you can live with these two issues and have a budget of around 40K then this is a great choice.,One,Great phone - but for battery,4.0
Srinivasan JV, 7 October 2019,Amazing smartphone. Super fast charger. Battery percentage reached 77% from 15% only in 26 mins. Thanks to Warp charging.The phone is super fast. I noticed a lot of difference from my previous phone (RN5 Pro) when it comes to paying using Paytm.The photos are coming really good.  Especially the photos that are shot in low light. The camera app itself suggests - based on the environment -when we should use the Wide landscape option.The only con is the unavailability of head phone jack. I wish OnePlus had provided the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the phone's package. Otherwise it costs ₹390 in Oneplus stores.Just go for it if you're looking for an upgrade. I trust you won't regret.,0,Amazing smartphone with awesome camera brilliant display and great battery life,5.0
Amicable, 11 November 2019,The display had a manufacturing defect and the company is not willing to support the customer while they are selling this experience ...

rodhika, 13 February 2020,Although i have heard a lot about the much hyped one plus series but i found it somehow disappointing; have experienced weird glitches with the phone that left me surprised . To name a few:1. My phone suddenly hanged and the power off  restart and other functions stopped working and i had to drain the battery to get it switched off and on again however it didn’t work ultimately i had to format and reset the phone entirely ; ended up losing quite some data.2. Another time i was watching a series on youtube and the phone heated up quite badly that i had to turn it off for it to cool down.3. The phone hangs sometimes.4. In another incident  the phone hung by itself and all the customised settings were turned off and there were weird malfunctioning tones on its own.I am unsatisfied with this phone as it was claimed to be so much but these weird glitches made it ‘Not so worthy’.I hope i get a revert from One-Plus  if at all the read the review,0,Not so worthy as it is hyped to be read full review for details,3.0
Pushpendra, 25 November 2019,Battery life is horrible  OnePlus didn't do anything to improve on that via s/w update.I think i feel cheated now they are selling the phone with applying all discount your are going to get around 33k. What the use of buying when customer buy on 1st sale ?Everyone should wait when there is more price drop .My Biggest let off is battery life and Amazon T&C cheated the customer as it doesn't have return policy and get back your money,One,All is Good except battery life about the phone.,2.0
Pankaj Bhatt, 8 June 2020,I wish my review will guide you in right way.This device is really fast . fingerprint reader is decent  face unlock is super fast  no lack while gaming and doing multitasking .This phone feels very smooth  you will definitely love its 90Hz screen refresh rate .Battery is decent not so great but the plus point is warp charge support  it  will charge your phone with lighting speed .Oxygen os is clean and very easily to customise.I found some lack in RAM management (it doesn't kill running apps quickly may be it has enough space to handle multiple apps) but later on OS updates will figure this out .Speakers are really great with Dolby Atmos .I have been using iPhone from last 3 years so if I compare color tones nd camera its not as good as iphone but decent enough to click good picture in night mode too .Overall if you never try you will never know  so just go and buy it becz in this range one plus 7T is best in android .,0,This phone is fast with brilliant sound quality.,4.0

Preeti, 23 January 2020,I heard about so much about OnePlus series phone and this time I decided to try OnePlus 7T. I do lot shopping with Amazon and I trust them but this time I was little bit worried bcoz I was paying such big about. But finally I received this in good condition and I am happy with my purchase 😊If I talk about mobile everything is good bcoz I am currently using it camera touch but the best part which I really like that is phone battery life. It's change so fast and once it's changed I don't need to change is again in my hole shift now I am not worried about it.,0,I am looking it 😍,5.0

Abyss, 2 January 2020,100% satisfaction with this phone thus far! Love the design the performance Oxygen OS it's a whole lot better than what my previous phone in Samsung was. Doesn't heat up at all never lags or hangs.With that being said it's early days I'm hoping it stands the test of time and it's only been about a month of usage but thus far I'm loving every second of it.Battery usage lasts for between 8 and half to 10 hours of screen on time usage and generally lasts for the 24 hours for a heavy user like me. Generally charges from nearly empty to a 100 in a little less than an hour. Charges to 90 in about 50 minutes and to 70 in little over half an hour.Not a huge camera user but from what I have used of it I'm satisfied with it. Phones like Pixel would obviously be better in that department but it wouldn't let you down. This is probably the only area where it's not flagship level. Otherwise it feels premium in almost every other way.,0,Best value for money phone out there in this price range. Flagship level in almost every way.,5.0
Azhar, 21 November 2019,Over all perfomance and the camera quality of the phone is unbeatable touch is super smooth and fast... Fingerprint reader is slightly sluggish when compared to other phones where sensors comes at the back of the phone and battery is kind of good  however this if for sure one of the best phones I've used so far ... Tough competetor for iPhone ... Elegant look ! Highly recommended,One,Power House,5.0
Sug_duker_390, 20 October 2019,First of all it's worth the price 🔥Camera quality is damn good 😍90hz display is dope 🔥For gaming purpose this mobile is perfect.💯PUBG and COD is butter smooth even in ultra graphics setting.❤️Battery life is good.Warp charge 3T is next level. 30 minz change and you are ready for one whole day of usage. 🔥And snapdragon 855 plus is super fast 🔥 no lags nothing.I would suggest one plus 7t over 7 pro and 7t pro..Coz those 2 are not worth the price..,0,"""The Best"" 💯",5.0
Vinay Prakash, 19 October 2019,I have upgraded from a One Plus 3t. This phone is really a perfect deal for this price. I have done enough research and was confused between 7t pro and this one but really happy with my decision of going with 7t.Battery though is not upto the expectations. Warp charge 30  adapter is provided in the box but all over the advertisement its 30t.,0,Value for money,5.0
Prabjeet Singh, 6 October 2019,The first question which strikes a common man is what makes this 38k phone different from other phones ranging under 20k. So I've been a Xiaomi user from starting. Under exchange offer I've exchanged Redmi 6 pro with this 7T. This phone has the uttermost best camera you could ever think off. Even in night it takes the best classy pics for you. The performace of this phone is amazing and is upto the mark. Overall you can also use it for vloging as I will be and it shoots the best video for you. Overall it serves all your purpose of GoPro cum DSLR.P.S: It serves the purpose. Individually GoPro and DSLR are better than 7T. But if you are looking for a complete pack in one go for 7T without any doubt.,0,Value for money,5.0
Stive brown , 23 January 2020,I am very disappointed by it Although this phone is good at allBut what I find bad is its proximity sensor . It goes on hold and dailed another number automatically while talking on call. Think if your angry boss is talking on other side and phone goes on hold automatically. It my second new replaced one plus 7T. I requested for refund but they assured  me that this problem will not be in new handset. Its my second day of using it. If the problem still goes for 3-4 for days . I will return it.,0,Phone is not good at this price . I am very disappointed by it.,3.0
prabhdeep singh, 24 June 2020,This phone is  having awesome and brilliant make qualityWriting this review after 20 days of usagePros1. Built quality is good having awesome glacier blue colour made with good finising in glass material.2. Screen resolution is too good at 90hz rate more clear than 2240 x 1080p coz i am having second mobile samsung A7 2018 with this resolution and it has much more resolution than oneplus5 and 5t.3. Sound quality of speakers is awesome it give u sound from both speakers. Speakers near charging point and speaker within receiver.4. Best for Macro shots with deeper details of image.5. Screen and running of apps is very much smoother no doubt about that its one plus brand with 855+processor.6. Camera quality far better Oppovivo Redmi of this segment phone coz i checked my friends phones camers in this price segment7. Playing games on 90hz is sharper and smoother8. WARP charger is too speed just in 20 mints  from 15 % to 85% amazingly fast.Cons1. On being delivery  apps and phone configraution  are not opening then i call amazon customer care for settings then it opens.2 On delivery of phone it needs to be update coz i can't take my normal video calls and after update i works fine.3. Phone is just bit heavier in this flagship ranger of other mobiles can't say too much just bit. If you looking for smoother working then this weight issue dosent matter i upgraded from one plus5 to oneplus 7t so i feel that much4. 3.5mm headphones audio jack point is missing there  and  also not having headphones in box.Rest if you are gamelover then this beast is for you coz running on 90hz dispaly resolution it will give u smoother experince.If u like my review do hit the like button,0,Nice and awesome phone love the beast,4.0
Rahul rajput, 2 October 2019,Great Features and nice look,5,Awesome Product,5.0
Ram Mokashi, 14 June 2020,Overall rating from my perspective is about 5 start after using this beast for whole one day.Below observations been observed as:1. Overall device come with mind boggling screen refresh rate of 90Hz and performance.2.  Battery can drain quickly if phone is being used with 90Hz refresh rate but can manage with battery optimization. But this problem effectively handled with WARP Charge 30 charger (believe me its FAST.)3. Oxygen OS is love. Come with no bloatware. Feels like stock android. Very FAST due to its best OS optimizations.4. Nice animations and customization to use.5. Display is also of good quality and has few options to set ambient display colors.6.  Speakers are of really flagship quality and its very loud and clear. No need to use headphones while watching movie or playing game. I think its because of there no HEADPHONE JACK and OnePlus has logically implemented this kind of speakers to compensate HEADPHONE JACK omission.7. Comes with SD-855+ processor. Obviously no need to discuss this point.8. Good camera (Could have been best but a big OKAY for me. But that camera bump I didn't like it at all).9. No issue with Bluetooth connectivity and Wi-Fi.10. Large and clear sound while calling. No call drops.11. Red Cable and OnePlus community is something to know whats going on with OnePlus (Specially I like these communities).12. I love unboxing feeling of OnePlus 7T. Loves those stickers and invitation card from Pete (CEO of OnePlus).13. Its TPU phone case is also of good quality and can be used for few months. It covers edges very well and camera bump as well. (If you can spent RS.1300 buck to get carbon case go for it.)14. Fingerprint scanner is insane fast and those animations comes in customization are quirky and looks something new.15. Face unlock is also insane quick. I tried it in light and low light it works so fast.,0,Nice product to buy even though one plus 8 is at door.,5.0
Shrijan Shetty, 31 May 2020,This is a phone that I would recommend even today over the OnePlus 8. The new model simply doesn't have enough features to warrant nearly 10000 extra apart from 5G(which is a few years from reality in india.ProsGood battery life(about 7&1/4 hrs with 90hz 8.5 hours with 60hz)Gear software basically stock android except with a few tweaks. Much better than the samsung I was using temporarily.Good quality display with small notch however the bottom bezel is a bit noticable.Great build quality however it's a bit heavyThe length is about a normal 5.5 inch display phone with normal bezels so you can imagine size as reaching the top corners of the phone to determine however it's a narrower display so not as wide.Speedy with bootup time of about 10 seconds and with 8gb ram it's really very nice in keeping apps in background. The OnePlus 8s processor is not much of an improvement and so this is better value.Speakers are very nice with two speakers the one in earpiece also works as speaker and it's quite loud have to keep at 70% volume.ConsCameras are not as good but I am not much of a photographer. The selfie camera is very good.OnePlus has fallen from their software update speed since the days of my OnePlus 3 and this phone has March security update as of end of May.Glass back so you have to keep this in a case to prevent breaking it. Display repairs are also expensive at about ₹12000So a pretty good phone for a good price at about 35000.,0,A nice phone with very little caveats,5.0
Amazon Customer, 29 February 2020,It has been a month since I bought One plus 7t... And I'm unsatisfied Right of the bat..  it seems the phone is very fragile and would not handle even a slight mishap.. which let's face it is unavoidable. I had Minor accident and dropped phone from a distance of 2 feet.. now of course this is not the first time I dropped I know the extent of damage it causes when you drop a phone and from what height I did not expect the damage to this level.. half the screen blacked out...dead pixels rendering the phone unusable within a matter of hour.. I should add that the phone was PROTECTED WITH CASE and guerilla glass... When I called OnePlus office for warranty/guarantee of course The damage was not covered bcoz it was an accident and not manufacturing defect.. so to have to put in additional 16000 rs to replace a month old screen seems very unfair... The welcome to OnePlus world is not really that great..,0,Very very fragile _ unsatisfied,1.0
Niyati , 7 October 2019,A true upgrade from Oneplus 7. Have been using it for 5 days and here are the pros and cons-Pros-+ 90 Hz display+ really fast charging in 30 mins it hits 70 %+ Oxygen OS having used Redmi phones this is much more smooth and definitely OS wise this feels more premium+ Macro mode is just great with really indepth close object clicking+ Gaming and Frantic mode - This has been there in other phones as well but is worth a mention+ No heat up issues till now - Played Asphalt 9 and COD for 3+ continously but didn't heat up+ Super fast face detection and fingerprint sensorCons- Image stabilization while clicking pictures was an issue sometimes- Battery lasts about 14 hours but with such fast charging its a non issue for me- The camera notch but it gets solved as most of us put cases- Colour options are only 2- No Memory card slot with very high resolution clicks your memory will get over very soon wpuld recommend you buy a 256 gb one for 2k more and not make the mistake I did- Earphones not included in the box. While I don't have much of a problem with removal of the 3.5 mm jack it should at least be compensated with USB C or bluetooth headphonesFinally the cons are not many and pros really outweigh them.Final rating - 4.5Verdict - Go for it at 38k its a steal,0,Almost as good as 7 pro at a much lesser price,5.0
Kiran G, 16 December 2019,"I bought this phone a month back with lot of expectations and enthusiasm since I already owned OnePlus 3 and was very happy with the phone. But all that enthusiasm and expectations died down within 3 weeks since my screen got damaged in an unusual way. The phone offers 90Hz Refresh rate with a very good display but at the cost of a risky design. I see this as a design / manufacturing issue which one plus is not ready to accept.The worst part is the Customer Support team and Servify (One Plus Care team) teams who are very unprofessional and change their stance every minute. I was initially told that the screen will be replaced since it was just 3 weeks after purchase. Later I was told to purchase a 1 year Accidental protection plan which I did at additional cost. After purchasing this plan they said I will not be covered for various reasons and the plan will be no more valid. I had to wait for one week with multiple calls and then shell out 12000/- Rs from my pocket to get the screen replaced. The Ad says Screen Protection (Pre-filled)...god only knows what this means. I am duped really with the worst customer service team of One plus.Yes while the phone is very attractive with lot of great features...do not forget the quote ""All that glitters is not Gold"". Keep this in mind before you shell out 35+ k to buy this phone.My only hope now is Amazon since I have reported the issue to them and hope they will do something to reduce the pain I went through.",0,BEWARE - Oneplus 7T has a very Sensitive Screen and WORST Customer Support and Servify Team,1.0
Prachet S., 5 October 2019,The phone is an absolute pleasure in your hands. The look is splendid.  Silver Matt back finish with mirror finish on the curves gives the classy looks it deserves. Have been using it since the last 4 days and here is a quick analysis:1. Processor is really fast. You can easily notice it as you flip between the apps2. Face recognition is super quick. At times before u even manage to put ya thumb for finger scanning the phone gets unlocked. Face recognition even in low lights is pretty impressive.3. The camera precision is brilliant. One can take stunning pics and with portrait mode on the selfie too makes it even better. Have not tested long distance and night pics so cannot comment on that as of now.4. Game mode is really cool if you are a gaming person which I am.5. The display is really bright and vibrant. You can easily feel the difference from the earlier phone that you were using6. Battery life is really excellent. I spend a lot of time on calls during office hrs and game while free time. But the battery really fights out time easily. Also the quick charge is super awesome. It barely takes like an hour for 100% battery. Just plug in for 15 mins and you can easily charge the battery good 40%.7. The phone comes with a soft transparent case so you need not bother with the drops.8. Loads of inbuilt features that will only add to the delight once you start exploring them.Bad pointJust that the charging cable is round instead of the flat cable which is not that simple to twirl and lock. Flat cable was a lot simpler. Also the cable length is standard1 mtr. I would have preferred if they gave 3 mts.,0,Absolute delight to hold in your hand,5.0
Amaldas, 9 November 2019,Just 2 weeks... The OnePlus has taken moments of life to another level. Yes there are Battery and Heating issues but still it does the job.Battery issue: it can be sorterd out by charging phone in off condition and allow it to drain upto 3% switch off the phone and charge fully. Repeat the same for 4-5 times. Battery backup will improve.Pro Camera does the job amazing picture quality. Front Camera also good and Nightscape mode is fantastic.,One,Amazing OnePlus,5.0

Vishal Chaudhary, 11 October 2019,Macro mode in camera is amazing!! And 90 hz refresh rate makes it lightening quick.Bluetooth has some major issues that OnePlus has not resolved yet. Can't connect to car infotainment system or my smartwatch which is very disappointing. Hope this gets resolved soon!!,2,Great camera but Bluetooth doesn't work,2.0
Hachiko, 5 June 2020,There are phones with better or similar features in this price range. However oneplus 7T is the most balanced phone you can buy in range of 30-35 k. The only downside would be the battery which drains out little fast on heavy use but the wap fast charge compensate by charging it fast very fast. Befoe this I had Iphone7 and believe me the OS experience is awesome I am really impressed. Camera is good except some color issue due to over processing. If you use Gcam that would solve your problem. Some sample shots attached.,0,Best All Rounder in this mid range segment,5.0
Kindle Customer, 10 July 2020,A nice product to invest your money. Everything awesome. Mainly I bought it for Snapdragon 855+ processor. There is no lag when I play in PUBG and 90 HZ display is one of the key features for gamers. Fnatic mode is a very good feature for gamers. The camera quality is wonderful. I was redmi user. When I switched tp One plusI can feel the difference. The battery is the main issue. 3800 mah is not enough. But we have the 30W warp charger support to fulfill that problem. I really amazed at how this mobile charges my phone from 0 to 100% within 1 hour.  Why oneplus does not provide connector in the box.There is no 3.5mm jack in this mobile. SO we need type C to 3.5mm jack adapter for use your wired headphones. Audio quality wise it is really nice one. Dual speakers with stunning sound quality. Currenlty I am playing PUBG without headphones only. You can feel the sound difference. Sound is the important factor in PUBG. Better puchase adapter from Oneplus store Lockdown time we can't get it. Limited places only they selling their products. Dsiplay quality is amazing. 6.55 inch Fluid AMOLED display. Mainly I bought this phone for processor and display only. Amazing quality. For PUBG players gyroscope works better There is latency time ! That's all.,0,One of the best android flagship killer in 2020,5.0
Bala Mr, 4 October 2019,Pros:# Sleek and Stylish in Design# Amazing display and great performance# Awesome sound clarity with Dolby Atmos speakers.# Camera clarity is absolutely amazing. The images are pretty cool and lively.# Oxygen OS is a big plus with the latest Android 10.# Charging speed is insane with warp charging 30. In less than 40 to 45 mins it will hit 0% to 100%# 90 Hz refresh is lightning fast and smooth.# Pretty good in-display fingerprint sensor.# Needless to say this is the best phone for PUBG COD and other high-end games.Cons:# Battery backup might let you down with 3800 mAH battery it lasts only 15 to 18 hours with moderate usage. If you play games expect it to drain sooner.# No headset in the box which could be a disappointment for the first time OnePlus users.# And this phone have USB type C port for earphones which is not quite uncommon though.Having these minor hiccups hands down this is certainly the best premium phone in the market at this price range. Undoubtedly 5 out of 5 from me.,0,Best in the Market!! Loved it!! 👆,5.0
ARUN KUMAR D, 13 October 2019,"Firstly I welcome myself to One plus family and welcome you all to the family too ( to whomever buys it)..Well the phone is just the best in class as on date..Really worth for money..Everything in it are damn new.  Snapdragon 855""+"" chip set.. All new 90hz display. Wide screen. Etc etcCamera quality well the images do come original when compared to other ones especially the all new developed macro mode. Super cool. But I still find a room for improvisation here & there.Hmm to say about battery.. that's where I can say one plus should have improved a bit. It's like we all have good fruits in hand but unfortunately the fridge isn't working properly 😁😁 something like that..3.8k mAh battery do support you as a nominal use but I say if we are into  games or internet (heavy usage) it starts draining.For a normal usage it dies to 1.5.

Amazon Customer, 20 October 2019,Been using this for a while and im fully satisfied with the camera.Beyond expectations...# i wont suggest using the face id as it has a major glitch.# The phone can be opened with a good photo of you.# Fingerprint sensor is good and fast.# The high refresh rates are visible clearly while use and in gaming.# preapplied screen guard is not of good quality and scratches comes fairly quickly.# case available with the phone is genuinely good quality and fit and finish is perfect.# dust seems to get to the back of the phone through speaker hole gap in case so cleaning once in a while is a good idea.# unlimited customisability is the best part of the phone.# battery is good but since i am a heavy user i found out that it wont last a day.# warp charging is perfect but i think it is getting slower over time.

Rahul Unde , 6 July 2020,The phone is overall good no doubt.But the phone they sent me was a defective piece.It has some green tint issues on the displayWhen the brightness is 10-40% the downside of the display gets this green hue and it looks green and dull while watching netflix and playing anything.Also there is this black crush issues too.Until I found this the return period was finished and now i don't know how to resolve.,One,Improper Defective Display,1.0
samridh shah, 6 July 2020,Purchased 7T in May 2020.....AFTER ONE MONTH OF HEAVY USAGE....Though 8 was launched too but after going through all the Comparison videos in YouTube I find 7T better than 8 in Many Ways.Guys 5G comes with Question Mark !!!!And Curved Display more tends to break for a guy like me. So I felt 10K as a waste for me. Both has 90Hz Display. No Camera Changes.Coming to Phone. ( Top Priority )Pros :-1. Display 90Hz You will never go back to 60Hz.2. UI :- User Friendly Amazing3.

Amazon Customer, 16 January 2020,I got this phone on the 2nd of Jan-2020. However I started using it only since 12th Jan-2020 since I was travelling to another country. On the 2nd day of usage itself the phone all of a sudden became dead( just a while it had around 30% battery so it wasnt a off due to battery). Tried to re-start even connected the charger for around 40 minutes however there was no activity on the phone( no LEDs and the phone wasn't booting up even no messages). After many tries I kept the phone as it is. I did some research and found many users complaining about similar issues( seems some issue with the phone motherboard). On the next day tried to power on and then it gave a message that the phone was too low on battery. After charging  it then booted up. So am gravely worried if this issue comes up again(looks like some internal phone issue) on such a premium phone. I am keeping my fingers crossed for now.  I was hoping for a better experience from a OnePlus phone but my initial experience isnt GOOD. Since I am out of town I didnt explore the option to returning the phone back. Hoping to hear from Oneplus about this issue and my future course of action if such an issue occurs again.,0,Phone suddenly became dead,3.0
Kavan, 22 February 2020,I've been using the phone for a month and half now and my experience has been great. I'll list below the few pros and cons that I found while using the phone. I used to have second thoughts about buy a notched phone cus I thought the notch would annoy me but after getting this phone I hardly notice the notch thanks to the amoled and deep blacks in a dark room the notch is completely invisible.Pros1. 90hz amoled display is amazing once you go 90hz there's no turning back to 60hz2. The phone weight is distributed equally and hence its comfortable for one had use for a long period of time3. The stereo speaker setup is better than expected4. RAM boost technology actually works well I see the apps I use often open up faster.5. Not much of a camera user but the sample pics I've taken have come out well6. Fingerprint reader is fast takes longer to unlock after a bath wrinkly fingersCons.1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided in the box2. The battery capacity could have been increased although using it in 60hz gives better battery life. But I don't think anyone is gonna do that :),0,Worthy purchase,5.0
Pravingupta, 6 October 2019,Look vise phone is good...camera is also good...working also fast.The main disadvantages is battery....is poorIf u are aheavy user ..than battery is not good last only 10 hrs backup...but thanks to  warp 30 charger it charge mobile 0 to 100 in just 40 minCharging speed is very good 5 out of 5 for charger..Price is high for this phone...27k is enough for the phone.,One,After using  of 5 days,4.0

Nilesh Mahendra Desai, 16 November 2019,"They say ""good things come in small packages"" and most rightly so this product does full justice to this adage.1.

They could have kept a horizontal or vertical module. But i got no complaints since i got used to it and the camera quality is quite a stunner. Please dont expect IPHONE results - each brand has its own strengths and weaknesses.2. This phone is perfect for gaming as well but then you would have to put it on charge because the battery backup isnt like the ROG series. But i aint a gamer so i dont care.3. No headphone jack. Type C usb  so only one charging port to be shared with type c earphones. Additonal kharcha if u dont own one.4.FHD+ AND NOT QHD PANEL - WHY ONE PLUS WHY?5. Gorilla Glass 5 and not 6 - this is sheer cost cutting.All in all - if i dont nitpick  i am very satisfied with this device. Its a beast and a perfect phone for mid to heav usage.

Ravi Kant Anand, 6 November 2019,Below are the issues listed after 10 days of usage:1. This is a performance phone absolutely no doubt about it but it isn't delivering the top notch performance it takes around 2-3 seconds to load just after restart.2. Caller picture is getting blurred. I tried with some third party apps also but the issue still exists with some caller. But when I set caller picture  for any contact with phone's default caller picture feature I'm still getting blurred image when I call someone.3. Sometimes (let's say 2 out of 10 times) when connected with Bluetooth headset the sound output flickers when phone is locked. Works fine when phone is unlocked. However it get resolved while I disconnect the device and reconnect.4. Sometimes I feel heating issues with this phone (I'm not a PUBG guy I don't play heavy games on phone). With normal usage I feel heating issues. However occurrence frequency of this issue is very low.5. Sometimes I don't see music navigation layout when phone is locked. I have to restart the device then able to see the navigation buttons on lock screen.I'll reach out to One Plus service center and hope they'll resolve it.Overall this is a good choice within 40k bracket  AMOLED + 90Hz display is awesome. Camera in daylight is great. Haven't tested the supermicro shots. Nightmode picture quality lies between good to very good (very good excluded).ThanksA satisfied One Plus user (If they resolve the above mentioned issues😃 ),0,Fix the listed issues and One Plus you'll be my all time favourite😀,4.0
Manav Chaudhary, 29 October 2019,Camera is nice and the phone overall performs very fluid and is a beast at multitasking and gamingFeels premium and classy.Only downside i see is lack of a headphone jack which could be sorted with an adapter ie usb c to 3.5 or to 3.5 and usb c.Also the case in the box is very premium... In case if this is imp to you.Audio quality through speakers and headphones is great.Lemme know anything specific you want to know :),0,7T,5.0
Prabhu kumar Neelam, 12 May 2020,On January 20th 2020 i have purchase OnePlus 7t mobile since performance of the phone is not good from march 13th facing lot of issues with mobile.

Kailash Gholap, 25 January 2020,I am a owner of Samsung S7 ordered oneplus 7T for my brother. Believe me my S7 has a superier display quality than 7T.Camera is also average same qaulity we can get in any phone around 20k.90 hrtz refresh doesn't make that much difference 120 hertz would have helped.Only thing i liked in this phone is that it has amazing sound quality but that is not what i bought the phone for..!,One,Not As Expected,3.0

Sandeep, 28 June 2020,Hi thereI received my order of OnePlus 7t on 17th June which started giving me trouble from 19th June. Phone hangs in between while using apps and then don't even allow me to do anything. I have to literally wait till it's battery is drained off so that it can get rebooted.I shared this complain with customers service and they schedule an appointment for 23rd June. I got technician details however on 23rd June I didn't get any call or notification from anyone to check my phone.Later I received an mail saying I wasn't reachable.So I again rescheduled my Appointment to Friday i.e. 26th June.Again I got all the technical details but on the day no one contacted me for testing my mobile.And today I got a mail saying my Mobile has been checked.How is that even possible?!This is outrageous!!And now want to replace this product because I already waited for long enough.Also please escalate this.,0,Issues with Amazon service and the product,1.0
uday, 29 February 2020,Actually oneplus 7t in performance and features are gud In my one month use I facing a network issue and lagging in 20% below battery watching hotstar I cant see the score of match sometimes apps are restarting automatic while using  and mainly starting I face a battery backup issue recently I got a update and it's cmg full 12 hour of continue use as before of 10 2 hour increased .But finally 4/5,0,Oneplus 7t one month,5.0
Yashwanth Raj, 3 February 2020,built quality seems very good ! and i didnt notice any lags or somewhat negatives till now ! im pretty comfortable and its really smooth in ! seen some negative reviews before buying this ! but i didnt noticed their issues ! mobile is handy and pretty fine with a good battery life !,0,best on budget,4.0
victor, 15 June 2020,Finally almost most 8 months I'm writing review..this is my first android after iphone I thought I won't like it but hey the OnePlus surprised me.Best display fast charging Dolby sound...But only one thing is battery draining too fast I have to charge two times ... I'm using 90hz display though..so ok but could be better,0,👍,4.0
Hanumanth, 22 December 2019,The phone performances is awesome. Someone can only compain about its battery life. Battery can only survive 4-5 hours on continued usage. About the camera it's not great in this price but it's quite quite powerful. Display refresh mind blowing. Over all 4 stars for this mobile,One,Good mobile but not great in this price range,4.0
Avg consumer, 8 October 2019,First of all mention that some people are getting poor battery including me for few days but after 3-4 cycles of charging poor battery became excellent. So please don't post the reviews without giving phone proper use time.I love my haptic vibrator due to that I want to tyyyyyype more on the keyboard.Screen colour reproduction is excellent 🤩on par with Samsung and even better in some areas(read Android authority review about screen). And 90 hz don't read about it experience itDual speakers are awesome 😍Cameras are miles ahead than my previous OnePlus 5 that's enough for meAndroid 10 gestures are awesome (copy from iPhone gestures)Light blue colour is excellent in person which was average in images.When I waited for my phone to charge🙄it was that fast and cool.Once go to OnePlus you will never comeback. It's not about featuresit's about experience.,0,If you want one go for it,5.0
Pankaj Vishwakarma, 6 October 2019,I am using oneplus products since the launch of oneplus one and till now used 5 oneplus models. Never faced any issue with any phone even after 5 years my oneplus one is still working.Now come to the 7T I am using this phone for the last 4 days and really happy with the performance oneplus always used a top-notch processor with 8Gb Ram and Oxygen OS just make everything flawless. This 90MHz screen on oneplus is the reason to opt for this device you can clearly see the difference in your device screen and oneplus 7T screen every single Fram is fast and smooth on this screen. Now they also improved sound quality with Dolby sound I was using 6T and it is a very huge improvement in sound quality. Now come to the camera yes camera is very good at 7T but do not expect quality like iPhone and pixel 7T camera can take very good shot and the way they give us the freedom to use the combination of three lenses is very useful I love this quick toggle between lense. The battery is decent for me I am a heavy use with all the time internet on easily getting 1 and half day battery and wrap charger is cherry on top this is the fastest oneplus charger only tool 45 minutes to charge phone from 20 to 100. If you really want a practical phone with the fastest Hardware and software just go for it no need to think twice.PS: I haven't checked gaming performance but I know this phone has the power to handle any kind of game.,0,A practical phone with performance of a flagship,5.0
Cheruvil Vishal, 8 June 2020,Its my 1st OnePlus device!! And just one word. The speed is beyond my control 😀.Awsm product with quick charge quick os quick snap and so on. So we can say it's quick in all ways.Previous I used samsung a50 and trust me samsung S10+ is not even near by the 7t performance.Ultimate beast in all the ways.Brief break down:Charge:0 to 70% - 35 min0 to 100% - 55 minCamera:Low light - 5 starPortrait - 5 starMacro - 5 starWide - 5 starOS:90hz is superbGaming:It warms up a bit in hiend setup but it's glass back!Speaker:Dual speaker is awsmProcessor:855+ is more than enoughConclusion ultimate fastest beast,0,The Speed In Your Hands. The Ultimate Beast,5.0
XLR8, 12 November 2019,Buy it and don't think twice: The OnePlus 7T is the new Android phone to beat for the money with a peerless 90Hz display excellent performance from the speediest CPU on the market and a lightning-fast-charging battery. The camera isn't the nicest you can buy though it's more than competent for the price,0,Still Best flagship currently with little on compromise,5.0
Hardik Maharaja, 5 January 2020,I have always been a OnePlus user since 2015 when I had my first OnePlus 2 phone. So this OnePlus 7T seems a wonderful upgrade to me after all these years. The big screen is a delight to use. Camera quality and features are excellent and phone is super fast with the huge storage and RAM. Face unlock fingerprint reader both work like a charm. Warp charging is fast and charges up the phone quickly. I would recommend this phone which has all the best features and design and at a good price range compared to other Samsungs and Apples.. Go for it! I got mine at 26k instead of 35k as I used my pending vouchers so it was a steal deal for me. 😉,0,Superb Bundle Value for Money Package!,5.0
Gaurav Singh, 3 October 2019,Completely satisfied with the device built quality no offence to camera bump haters personal preferences.My main reasons to buy OnePlus 7T over 7Pro would be for 90Hz screen panel dual stereo audio speakers macro camera lens faster then ever charging speed and improved efficiency in phone handling ergonomics in everyday use.All of it at this price point OnePlus has accomplished a perfect and powerful device for average everyday user.Received this product in less than 30hrs faster then ever thanks to Amazon.,One,Value without a doubt,5.0
Rarichan Mathew, 20 October 2019,Great performance.High quality camera.Super fast Charging.Quick fingerprint reading and face recognitionAwesome designBattery backup is also good when compared to a 3800mah batteryThe only thing is that you have buy a good cover which covers the back camera bumb to avoid scratchesOverall 4.5 out of 5,0,The best,4.0
Nisarg, 6 October 2019,Got the phone on 29th Oct. Thank you Amazon.I really like the smooth and fluid feel when I use the phone.Pros worth to mention :Dolby AtmosSmooth and fluid 90-hertz screen. Good for gamers.Wrap charge 30T is superbOne plus claims blue light reduction from the screen.Not to mention 855+ processor + 8 gb ramCons:Photo quality is somewhat  inferior in comparison with iPhone 10s and 11Apart from this One Plus 7T is a very good phone.,0,Pros and cons worth to mention.,4.0
Lalit Goyal, 1 November 2019,Camera could have been better.Cons: 1. Take longer time to click photos. My infant child changes posture rapidly. 7T camera unable to catch him properly.2. Night scape mode is very bad. All most all photos are blur.3. Red eye removal feature is not present. If u click somone camera using flash then in photos persons will be having Red eye.Other things are good about this phone including performance battery backup.One star less for camera.,0,7T good phone with avg camera,4.0
Amazon Customer, 24 December 2019,As everyone know it's an amazing mobile. Smooth touch fingerprint reader is wow battery life I can say okay but warp charging is superb.Things I don't like is camera it process the photo and saves the photo of 2-4Mb max if not clicking on pro or raw. As a photographer I m not satisfied with the quality.Gaming wow.,One,Not satisfied with camera.,4.0
Prajwalit S, 22 January 2020,I am using this handset for last 1 month. But i am facing some issue with the earpiece and the mic. Sometimes the  other person doesn't hear my voice.Otherwise the handset is awesome but comparitively heavier than my old Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. I have been using premium mobile phones for a long time it feels less premium (that's personal opinion). Build quality is solid. Amazon's delivery is lightning fast. By and large the One Plus 7T is awesome.,One,Next Level Android 1+7T,4.0
ARKADEEP GHOSH, 17 November 2019,First of all thanks to Amazon for there quick delivery within 24 hours along with exiciting exchange offers. Thank you Amazon!The product was delivered in a unique sealed tamper proof bag with a unique ID for your security.Coming back to the product it's a swashbuckling deal adding all the discounts along with exchange price at just ₹31700!Pros:1. 3 rear cameras with 1 being the main camera other two for wide angle and close up shots. You will enjoy photography at night (low light) photography too with this device.2. 90hz refresh rate with fluid amoled display.3. 855+ processor makes the device buttery smooth.4. Inbuilt ram boost management.5. Fast face unlock6. Comes with protective case with cushioned corners that protects your screen even if it drops from 2-3 feets. It also protects the bumpy camera.7. Warp charging with 100% charging within 1hour 10 minutes.8. Alert slider for changing profile modes.9. Extended 1 year warranty on registering the product on one plus care. You can also refer your friends and earn points to redeem.Cons:1. No headphone jack you have to buy a connector or OnePlus bullet headphones seperately.2. Fingerprint reader is bit of a issue since it doesn't work properly 10-20% of the time.3. Gets heatedto some extent on contunuous usage (depends on what application you are using though).4. Battery life is not the best if you are a hardcore gamer however it's get along well for a normal daily usage at 60hz refresh rate lasting for more than a day.Conclusion:A great device for daily normal usage clicking really snappy photos for an enhanced viewing experience. Only if you want a better battery life with a bezel less design (not even a notch) and a better ram management you can think of going for OnePlus 7T pro by spending that extra 16k. Nevertheless it's a great buy worth every penny!And now if you are in a dilemma whether to wait for Rog Phone 2 or not my suggestion would be only go for that if you are into hardcore gaming almost for 12*7. Otherwise it's not available in stock all the time and flipkart doesn't provide great exchange offers along with Asus like OnePlus does in different festivals like diwali and i hope in upcoming Christmas also they will be providing the extra discount facility in exchange of phones. OnePlus has a referral program on various occasions that gives you extra 2k off and adding to that different bank offers makes OnePlus the best buy over Rog phone 2 since both are priced at the ₹37999 (base variant).Hope this review will help all the reader's peace out! ✌️🤘,0,The flagship phone at mid range price!,5.0
AJEET KUMAR, 2 June 2020,I am reviewing this device after one day of usage and I think the words can't describe it all.U purchase it than feel it.As I was using iphone7  for last three years and u know the battery backup of old generation.we need to carry power bank with us for every outgoing.I want to purchase a new mobile and first thought came to my mind was one plus and when I read the reviews about one plus batteryI was little worried.But now it is in my hand and I am reviewing thisI charged this full at 10 PM and now it's 8 PM next day .it is still having 10% of battery.so all I wanna say don't think too much before purchasing it.It's a killler phone in each and every aspect.The main thing of concern was  battery issue and now I hope I have cleared a bit and as u already know in every other aspect it is master.Camera 10/1090hz 10/10Look 10/10Sound 10/10Sensor 10/10,0,BEAST PERFORMER,5.0
Avantika, 4 October 2019,A perfect phone with great performance and great look. Using around a week now and I am very happy with the phone so far. Battery life is good lasts for more than 24hours with mild usage. Camera quality is excellent. Front camera is also superb. Really OnePlus 7T is a complete package.Amazon's service is awesome and fast.You need to buy headphone jack or wireless earphone separately.,0,It fullfilled my expectations.,5.0
Saurabh, 8 October 2019,Honestly speaking... It's a great device. Camera is one of the main highlight of this device. And the wrap charge 30T is extremely fast. It charge the phone in an hour. But there is only one issue that I am facing is raise to wake and tap to wake is working properly in my device. Means sometimes it's working and sometimes it's not. The issue for this is I've press the power button then only I am able to unlock the screen. I hope this issue will get resolved in near future.,One,Great phone but a minor issue.,5.0
saurabh bothikar, 27 January 2020,I m speechless with the quality and features that oneplus provides.One plus 7t is absolute marvellous crafted product .It has got a very fast fingerprint reader and a very fast face unlock ...the speed of the mobile is very fast and switching from one app to another is is so easy now .Thanks oneplus for such an amazing product .The only problem I encountered was the battery .The battery gets exhausted very soon but if you use it to the nominal rate it can survive for a 11-12 hrs .Not useful for watching movies or playing games for a long time without charging.It has got an Excellent camera with 2-4 option for zoom distance and many other options in pro mode .Dark mode is also good .,0,Oneplus 7t is beautifully crafted masterpiece,5.0
PRADEEP SINGH, 19 November 2019,This phone is a masterpiece... 👌👌👌👌PROS-1) Fast speed of this phone is unbelievable2) Best touch i have ever seen3) Best display with superb gaming mode4) the most impressive part is dolby atmos speaker.. it gives a out of the world feeling5) superfast face unlocking in microseconds6) Night mode camera is unbelievable and Macro lens can take clear photo of even a pen nib..7) stunning premium looks CONS-I was using iphone 7 which is one of the slimmest and handy phones of all time.. So being a first time user of bigger size screen phone.. I found it a bit bigger while handling with one hand... but if you compare similar size phones then this is one of the most handy phone available in market today.,0,MASTERPIECE 😍😍,5.0
Pinaki sarkar, 26 November 2019,There is nothing to dislike about it but this is rather a suggestion for OnePlus . As per my knowledge and many tech reviews the back glass is very fragile of the OnePlus 7t .This is mostly because of the large camera cutout in the glass panel .The camera's are horizontal under the glass so I think it would have been better if the camera style would have been like the Galaxy s10 thus would have raised the durability of the overall device.,One,The durability fact..,4.0

Yash sethi, 17 October 2019,The phone works Amazing. I was using one plus 3 before buying this product. One plus is becoming bigger and better. The phone is smooth runs efficiently even if there are multiple apps running at the background.I transferred the entire data through one plus switch app and it took 20 minutes to transfer 40 Gb data. the finger print scanner and face recognition features are just cool. The battery has a great back up. It doesn't exhaust easily. The phone box contained a silicone case and a prefit tempered glass. The phone interface is new and different than other Samsung Smartphones which looks alike.. The company offered one year screen replacement through acko insurance which is a blessing in disguise.Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone..,0,One plus 7 t performance.,5.0

Sharath Kumar T, 11 December 2019,I just love one plus brand first I started using One plus one then 1 + X then 1 + 3T and now bought 1 + 7T. Camera quality build quality are just amazing but battery is sort of disappointing for me. If you use vigorously with net on and multiple applications you've fully charge the phone twice a day. They are trying to make it up with Warp charge but I am still not satisfied. So I will go with 4 stars,0,Great Phone with average Battery Life,4.0

Navneet Thapa, 4 November 2019,Top notch smartphone with the best specs available in the market right now. I am more than happy with the product it aces every aspect of the smartphone kudos to Amazon for such a fast delivery delivered my product the very next day of ordering and kudos to OnePlus for making this beast of a phone which serves all purpose. The photos I attached with my review were taken with OnePlus 7t front camera. Both the rear cameras and the front camera are excellent and comparable with the likes of iphone 11 which is twice as expensive atleast here in India. There is ois and eis for video recording which is super stable the rear cameras can record the video upto 4k at 60fps it's just the front camera only supports video recording at 1080p 30 fps no 4k support on the front camera.,0,True Flagship smartphone,5.0
Maisring Jigdung, 13 October 2019,It’s awesome !! The phone is super smooth and there is no any lag and the camera is outstanding 38k is value for money and the display is super amazing. The camera quality is outstanding it has 2x optical zoom 10x digital zoom and the ultra wide angle is superb !! It works really well on low light with it's new nightscape feature which will optimize the image and gives you the best image in low light . I was really impressed by the video quality which has ultra wide angle support in video mode 2x zoom 10x zoom  and it even has video stabilization which was really impressive all those mode can be shoot in 1080p 30 fps and 4k 30 fps but the ultra wide angle doesn't support in 1080p/ 60 fps 4k 60 fps. But then I was surprised with 4k 60 fps which is ultra smooth just like iPhone 11 pro video quality. It has the best video quality in this range which no other companies will provide you with this amount of money . It has the best spec in such a low price as compared to other flagship phone . And the performance is on the next level with the combination on snapdragon 855 plus and 90 hz refresh rate and the front firing dual streo speaker with game space and fanatic mode takes gaming experience to the next level which you won't find such experience in any other smartphone in this price range . I wonder why a lot people complaint a lot about the battery when it does gives you decent average with 3800 mAh. I only need to charge for 30 min which gives me almost a day battery life . The charger is super amazing with the wrap 30t which insanely charge in no time . It only takes 54 min to fully charge from dead phone 0% to 100% which is super fast which I have never experienced in any other smartphone in this price segment . My video experience with this phone is incredible with the fluid amoled display it gives you immersive video experience and the dual front firing speaker is so loud and clear which gives the video experience to the next level . The indisplay fingerprint sensor the super . This is my honest review after 3 months of usage  .,0,The perfect budget all rounder flagship smartphone 2019. The real flaighip killer is here!!,5.0
Dr. Rahul D, 14 February 2020,Mediocre phone not upto the hype created about it. Lacks in terms of extensive menu details software to name a few.

Amazon Customer, 15 October 2019,This is the fourth one plus phone I had bought after one plus 2 5 and 6T. One plus 2 just gave up recently after 4 years of usage. Decided to replace it with this new phone. No complaints so far with butter smooth operation on Android 10 and oxygen OS. My usage is limited I have been charging only once for a day and by changing the refresh rate to 60HZ  the charge on phone really stands out. The camera is good but could have been amazing.  Overall a amazing piece of product for this price.,0,Butter smooth,5.0
PB, 20 November 2019,The phone is amazing. But my device(s) had few issue issues including display issue.1. It used to have a pink tint occasionally especially on low brightness. It was clearly visible.2. Auto rotate and auto brightness were stopping sometimes.3. The screen below the area of fingerprint scanner became unusable sometimes.I complained to Amazon and they were really helpful. I got a replacement. But sadly the replaced device had the exact same display issue. Maybe the batch has got some defect or it's a software issue only experts can tell.Amazon helped again and gave me a return.I really liked the phone though. It has amazing camera speed sound and battery life. But I didn't want to keep a faulty device hence I returned it.

Sameer, 23 November 2019,After iPhone my favorite Android phone. Actually I'm iPhone users from last 5 years and I switch to Android after 5 year so there are lots of Android phone in the market even they are more expensive than 7t but I that's words guys you can buy OnePlus 7t blindly if you are photoholic or Gamer or you want better bettery life.. little issue with finger print just little maybe they resolve problem soon.,0,One+ Beat the iPhone,5.0
Mohit, 8 November 2019,Im writing this review after over a month of using the device ..let me start with the overall experience .Overall  phone is performing pretty well only downside is the software ..Oxygen os is the best version of Android no doubt but there are lots of glitches which are evident while using the phone on day today basis ..First of all the phone chooses if it should ring or not ..Sometimes even with ringer on it goes on silent automatically .Since it's my business phone I have missed maximim calls on daily basis..Second 3rd party apps don't perform how they would usually perform on any other Android device ..Especially WhatsApp ..It keeps hanging when we do a broadcast..Hence have to restart immediately to get back on it ..Other than these software glitches the phone is decent overall ...my Asus Zenfone 5 z was definitely a better performer ..Should've gone for the Rog phone 2..,0,Great Hardware but not so great Software,3.0

Palwinder S., 8 February 2020,This phone is a beast if I talk about android phones. I purchased this one as a secondary phone. My primary phone is an iPhone. I must say display of Oneplus 7T is more sharp and better than my iPhone. Snapdragon Processor is just amazing and extremely fast. Build quality is also great. I would recommend this.,0,Simply a beast!,5.0
Bhavin Bhatt, 6 October 2019,Good Phone. Very good display (only Samsung dynamic display is upper than this). Touch response good. Battery A little poor which is no enough for 90Hz display that's why Asus ROG Phone 2 has given Monster battery 6000 MAH. (Yes I know Asus ROG 2 has 120 Hz display yet).Camera good but not compete with my older Pixel 2XL which is still so good for Camera lover. But good camera.Performance super fast.

ujjwal k., 6 December 2019,My phone is not working up-to one plus expectations. Camera quality is very poor may be due to upgradation. Not taking clear pictures in night.

Dharmesh Goswami, 29 October 2019,This is my first Oneplus device. My previous device was Mi A1. I have been using this device since 9th Oct and below are my inputsCons1. Camera images lack sharpness.2. Portrait mode images are below average.3. Hanging issues when used camera continuously for long time.4. Too many bugs. Ex. Not able to upload images in WhatsApp many a times need to restart for make it work. Intermittent issues that restricts usage of camera to capture video.5. Fingerprint scanner is not reliable.Pros1. Good display.2. Faster processor.3. Fast face unlock.4. Fast battery charging.One plus have spoilt it's image and trust by releasing such an unstable device. It might be to take advantage of festive season but has put customers in dilemma to return it or wait for Oneplus to fix such serious bugs.I have replaced a piece after it failed performance test of Blancco(Amazon testing tool) once and I faced issues in both devices.Based on my experience I would like to return this device. When I use available option to return the device I am shown message to contact One plus for solving problems. I feel cheated with this message from Amazon . I will call them and check available options for returning it.,0,Bull released without taming,3.0

Lionel Lloyd, 20 June 2020,Hello everyone! You might be thinking like me what might be the best deal on the phonesadly I couldn't see any reviews mentioning how much they gave for the phone on which sale....hence I will do that before that quality and everything is fine there are a lot of detailed reviews and I agree with them..moving on I bought this phone for 37000 I.e 1000 discount through SBI card to my surprise  merely after 3 days amazon comes up with another 1000 cashback along with SBI cardhence making it 36k looking at which I regret buying it for an extra 1000 sometimes it's always better to wait and watch  until the last date of a particular offer period to see if some other offers stagger up and get you a good profit....To sum it up the best deal I have seen is 36k so if you are currently viewing that price then go for it,0,Detailed  price discussion (8gb+256gb),5.0
Abdul Mohi, 20 October 2019,It's a great phone. Phone lasted for more that 6 hours at the first week of usage. Now it only lasts about 3 - 5 hours screen on time. Camera is good. Games are amazing. PUBG and COD run with no lag. I haven't faced any heating issues. One thing I hate after switching from my OnePlus 6 to this is that they didn't include the previous gesture that was present in Android 9. I checked in 7 7 Pro and they had it.,One,Worth every penny.,4.0
Rajiv Shaw, 5 November 2019,So I've been using this device since last week and this is my first flagship phone previously I was using Moto G5s Plus both them have same camera cutout :p. I have attached some camera samples which i clicked using nightscape mode normal and macro mode.I was confused between Oneplus 7t and Asus Rog Phone II but Rog wasn't available so i chose this and really satisfied by it's performance. First of all I'm not hardcore gamer i usually play for hour or two. This phone provides great graphics without getting any heating issue at all. This phone has great battery life as well. I charge it once in a day and it gives me full day battery easily. I use it in 60 hertz and dark mode as it soothes my eyes.It gives you great in-hand feel. It is not so heavy.The thing which i didnt like that is it doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and the screen is long but it fits in my pocket very easily.I wanted frosted silver but wasn't available so i bought glacier blue which is really good with it's cover,0,Pocket friendly and incomparably good design flagship phone,5.0
Amit G., 6 October 2019,It's been less than a week that I am using this phone and I think I made the best decision to pay a little extra and go for OnePlus 7t instead of OnePlus 7. I had also considered going for Samsung S10e but OnePlus took my heart with its feature richness as explained below out of which half of the features are missing in Samsung S10E.I think the display of OnePlus is far far better than the display of Samsung Phones which I considered to be the best so far.The specs provided are too good for the price. The specific specs that I loved are -1. Fluid Amoled Display2. SPEEEDDD (the 7th generation of OnePlus phones is known for its speed and it holds to that promise very well). Samsung stutters after a while with speed.3. Dolby speakers (you really don't need Bluetooth Speakers anymore)4. How can I forget Oxygen OS! If you're into hassle free yet minimum customisable OS then this one's for you.5. Camera is great too. Look in the attached samples for clarity in outdoor lighting conditions. Also a wide angle shot which does a great job with the field area covered.6. Playing PubG in gaming mode at top-end levels is super smooth and flawless.7. Fingerprint Sensor is pretty fast. Didn't experience even a single moment of complaining about indisplay sensor.8. Battery life decent enough for 9-10 hours on moderate usage but the Warp Charger makes up for all the lacking points here. Thats too quick.9. Super Macro is amazing. I loved to play around with it. Please have a look at samples which were taken keeping the camera too close to the subject and the details captured were awesome.The only con that I particularly didn't like was a - No headphone jack but when you see the overall Package. It really don't matter to me much.It looks premium and IT IS A PREMIUM ANDROID EXPERIENCE. Myself being an FANdroid lover this is the best Android I have ever used.*Reasons to buy or not to buy -If you love Android and don't want to spend more than 40K than go for it without thinking twice !!!Unless and until you're an Apple fan and really want to go for iPhone 11 which is nearby the price range of this than this is the best option in this price segment.,0,Never Ever Settle - 7t just made me a OnePlus Fan! Loved the device.,5.0
Akash, 19 May 2020,Been using it for over 3 months its a treat. One of the only downsides that I faced with this mobile is some bugs with a couple of popular apps like WhatsApp where the Gboard hangs when I try to switch to another app. Although bugs like this are not uncommon when it comes to android devices it is still a factor u must consider whenever u have u choose between IOS and Android as IOS is far less buggy.,One,Great phone but some annoying bugs,4.0
Pritam Brahma, 3 November 2019,Its the best premium phone at this rate. I have been using this phone for last one month. Charging speed is suprising back camera quality is awesome. OS and updates are fabulously packed. Oneplus front camera needs some update. I would give 8.5 out of 10. 1 mark deducted for pricing which could have been worked out. 1/2 mark for front camera. It's like a must have phone in your pocket.,0,Best premium phone,5.0
Amazon Customer, 18 June 2020, My phone got delivered today. Having worst experience unable to switch it on. It is going to reboot loop as soon as I try to switch on. Even after pressing power button plus vol down button nothing stopping from reboot. Actually the thing is I even haven’t set up the phone yet it went to reboot as soon as I took it outside the box and tried to switch on for the first time. Now I will return the phone it doesn’t worth the money and the time. Hoping for better amazon customer service in returning the product at least.,0,Reboot loop issue,1.0
Mathachan Vadakkel, 30 May 2020,OnePlus have made a great change in the 7 series. The camera is way too nice and the AMOLED display is also pretty good. The phone is so smooth than I've imagined.The fingerprint is pretty good and it's fast. The battery life is also good.The thing I hate is:The camera bump- the camera is fine but I'm not so satisfied with the camera bump. It actually represents the Motorola series. But my point is it's too bumpy. Other OnePlus varients doesn't have this kind of a problem and still I don't know why this came up with OnePlus 7t. But I've made a solution by having a spigen rugged case which cots almost 800/-. It's actually preety good with the OnePlus 7t and it fits perfectly.,0,Wonderful but a bit of having a problem,5.0
anmol, 12 October 2019,Actually my concern is regarding your one plus 7t I ordered this phone on the first sale but after using it for two days I got to see many defects in my phone but after then i replaced with another one n I got new 7t but after one day of use I am getting the same issue.i am first time user of one plus and I don't know what m getting.

Gurudarshan Manickam, 18 October 2019,Love the forested silver color.! Display is just awesome the finger print scanner and the face unlock combo is so fast that It feels instantaneous on press of the power button camera and picture quality could be even more better which I hope will be taken care of in upcoming updates performance wise it's a beast once you enable the developers option and change the animation to 0.5X scale the phone just blazes through getting solid one day battery after 6.3hrs of gaming(call of duty pubg) lots of browsing and songs(video) and no heating issues yet though I doubt it has the cooling unit like oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 pro and oneplus 7t pro. The speakers are  way too loud which is a good thing for movies games and songs bad thing that even the earpiece at the lowest level of volume is loud enough that the person next to you can hear the conversation pretty accurately in an office or silent environment.  Best buy for the money needless to upgrade to oneplus 7t pro and oneplus pro just for the pop-up camera(which can be annoying when you have have face unlock enabled as it will pop up every single time you try to unlock the phone eventually will worn-out the motor lot faster) and higher display resolutions which saves loads of money. Fastest charging I have ever seen. And hardwares specs are all upto the current trend that you don't have to even think of upgrading your phone for a very long time.,0,Best buy for the money.,5.0
Nidhi, 18 October 2019,The phone is overall good. Nice camera Good speed.But there are a few things which I am disappointed about.Cons:1. These new phones have Type C as headphone jacks but Oneplus didn't even provide with a Type - C Converter. which is a drawback.2. Whatsapp hangs when on the video call. I cannot use WhatsApp while being on the video call.If the company can rectify these problems it's an amazing phone to have.,One,Good Phone but with a Few Cons,3.0
Vidhi Sanghvi, 15 December 2019,I was skeptical at first about buying a phone online due to scams we hear about every day but i did buy it and have been so happy with my buy it was so secure and the phone got delivered next day and am using for about a week now no complaints i love the phone one plus always aces in the quality i did read reviews here where people have complained about the fact of having no jack or slot for headphones which i dont miss as i am a wireless Bluetooth user.

Richard Basumatary, 17 October 2019,Everything about the OnePlus 7t is absolutely great as far the performance is considered. But one thing which still bothers me is that it crashed while I was playing Call Of Duty mobile. Like literally I couldn't finish the game at all. Now I'm no expert but one thing is certainly obvious that OnePlus 7t is a device which should be able to withstand high graphic games in extreme modes. However I doubt if it could have been a software problem from the game itself unable to run smoothly on my device or was it my phone's problem? I don't know...all things considered #PUBG works Great on my phone even in extreme graphic OnePlus 7t can pull it off without a sweat. But I gotta tell you though your hands are gonna sweat it out.😜#Fingerprint Scanner.It's okay and not so fast as those dedicated finger prints sensors I'd say but sometimes it failed to recognize my own finger prints!! So I'd give it 6 out of 10. And I've got my reasons for rating it that way and it's pretty convenient if I'd explain why besides it's much easier to understand practically.😅#Camera PerformanceIt's pretty great I love the way OnePlus represents their Camera Performance although it's not up to Max. Nightscape mode works better when there's more light in the background.🥰,0,Great Performer in this price range although lots of improvements still could have been added.,3.0

Nithin Raj, 25 October 2019,Excellent phone. Fingerprint reader is crazy fast. Camera is second tier in terms of smartphone quality which is still great especially considering the price. Battery life is awesome getting around 7 hours of screen usage time with social networking and YouTube at moderate brightness 4-5 hours gaming at moderate brightness. With warp charging I got from 11% to 93% in around 55 minutes. There is no overheating even after extensive gaming. Performance is ultrasmooth with SD855+ and the awesome 90Hz display. I have played only COD on this phone. With max graphics quality high frame rate and anti-aliasing turned on the game still plays very smooth. Great colours with accurate blacks on the AMOLED screen but max brightness is slightly short of adequate. You'll struggle a little bit under the sun. Adaptive brightness needs fixing. Tends to turn the brightness down too much. The stereo speakers would've been amazing if both of them were front-facing but only is. They're still loud and clear. Multitasking is exceptional with apps not shutting down even after gaming. Social media feeds resume/refresh from where you left off. Overall well bang for the bucks!,0,Plus One for the phone!,5.0

Royce Fernando, 7 October 2019,First of all the phone is really great. The phone does have its pros and cons. Im writing the review for people who are thinking of buying this.Pros:1) Snapdragon 855+ processor with 90Hz of refresh rate means the phone doesn't lag or hang. If it does check with the buyer. Most people on amazon dont check the buyer and end up crying foul.2) Finger print and face unlock its really impressive with the speed.3) It has a customized Oxygen OS and that works pretty well with the kind of customization the brand has put in.4) Design and the matt finish gives the phone a stylish look.5) Battery life is really good. I have almost 300 plus apps and I easily use it for a day or two with all the surfing and writing mails. The warpt charger charges the phone somewhere between 30 to 45 minutes.6) Dolby speakers and colors of videos bring it to life.Cons:1) Doesn't have a ear jack and the brand doesn't provide an earphone which is pretty bad as a user is paying close to 37k to 40k.2) I thought the camera is ok. They could have done much more with the quality. Tag disappointed with it.3) The phone did heat up initially raising a concern but over time it hasnt been that bad.4) Not sure about the quality of buttons and lastly they havent officially mentioned anything about waterproof and dust proof.Overall its a good phone. Hope it gives a bit of insight for people who want to buy this phone. Cheers.,0,One Plus 7T Honest review for new buyers.,4.0
Vikram, 3 October 2019,This is my review after 2 days :Screen: Coming from a screen with a higher resolution than the 7T I was weary about the screen. However the AMOLED screen on this phone blew me away with it's contrast and brightness. The 90Hz screen is another killer feature. A lot of people still seem to wonder if it makes a difference I think it does. A friend of mine who hadn't heard of this phone before tried it and was immediately impressed by the smooth scrolling and animations.This is most definitely the best aspect of this phone.Performance: This is phone is rapid! I haven't encountered a hiccup yet. I do not game and hence cannot comment on the gaming performance. However I am a heavy user and didn't find anything that slowed down this phone. I'm also very pleased with the clean Android experience with Oxygen OS's useful features. Both face recognition and the finger print scanner are fastBattery: This is where I was seriously doubting the capabilities of this phone. However I'm pleased to report that I've had more than 6.5 hours of screen on time on both days. This included a lot of YouTube and Netflix using the phones speakers. This phone should easily get you through a day of use. I had also kept WiFi Mobile Data (4G) and Location on at all times. Unless you are expecting something that lasts for 2 days  this phone won't disappoint. The new Warp charge 30T is amazing as well.Speakers: The speakers are something I did not consider much about while purchasing this device. But they've impressed me immensely. Dialogue is crisp and it gets plenty loud. I did try using my wired earphones with a OnePlus USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor and I didn't have any issues with the sound.Cameras: I have not tested the camera enough to post a review about them nor am I a photographer. I will update this review when I do take more picturesHand feel: The phone feels solidly built. I did expect it to be heavier. It doesn't feel heavy at all and the weight is distributed very well making it very easy to hold. Make no mistake it is a large phone. However I found it much easier to handle than the 7 Pro which I was considering thanks to the flat screen slightly narrower width and the evenly distributed weight.I do wish they did provide a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor in the box. (3.5mm jack would be ideal. But that ship has sailed). Apart from this minor gripe I'm very happy with this purchase.(For context I have used a Samsung S5 iPhone 6 iPhone 6S Plus iPhone 7 Plus and Nokia 8 as my daily drivers before this),0,Go for it!,5.0
Kandi, 13 February 2020,I had lot of expectations with this phone. But after 3 months of usage this phone is lagging like any other mid range samsung phone. It's better to buy a 20k samsung phone than this plastic mobile. The 90hz display has got nothing new when your phone keeps on lagging there is no point having other features.Don't buy this phone ever,One,Don't buy this phone,1.0
Aashley S., 10 November 2019,Not going for the specs as they are already writtenThis phone is fast asf...90hz and oxygen os is one of the best out there.Battery life can be a slight issue for very very heavy user .. upon full charge I can play 3 hrs of PUBG and 2 hrs of yt and WhatsApp it can last for the day .. ending at around 10-15 percent but then again if u can charge it just once for half an hour it will give u an amazing battery performance.Thanks for warp charge.Only thing is 35mm jack it's not there u need to get official dongle from the store for it to work because the audio output except the official one is trash 3 Rd party vendor dongles won't give u nice audio ..I also faced issue during calling sometime(around 10 percent) where my voice was echoed for few seconds,0,Blazing fast,5.0
Suraj Gome, 11 December 2019,I was never a OnePlus lover but then I researched about it saw reviews and videos for performance and quality and finally bought this and now I feel it's really a performance beast. Camera of this device is stunningly amazing all modes are well optimized with the hardware to take the best shots even the nightlife picture are far better than rest of the flagships.

Ankit Thakur, 25 January 2020,Pros:1. 90hz display giving a really smooth experience.2. Snapdragon  855+ processor giving great performance.3. Warp charge 30T helps charge the phone amazingly fast.4. Build quality is really great. The phone looks gorgeous and premium to hold.5. Stereo speakers in the phone gives immersive experience while watching videos and playing games. It is loud and clear.6. Haptic vibration makes gameplay better. I really liked it.7. Oxygen Os gives best user experience. Period.Cons:1. Camera quality is descent not great. It click some amazing shots but not exceptional as expected.2. Battery life is not that good maybe because of 90hz display. Normal usage can provide you full day battery life but if you play games then battery will take a great hit.Overall a great buy at this price point.,0,A great buy at this price point.,5.0

NIRMAL TAMKORIA, 22 May 2020,Originally I was an iOS consumer it's quite hard to switch from iOS to Android but believe me I have been using OnePlus 7T from past 1 week and I can say that this one hell of a phone be it Camera wise battery wise performance wise price wise and above all interface between hardware and software is exceptional. Go for it. Money's worth. #WELLDONEONEPLUS #KEEPITUP.......),One,Awesome phone go for it.,5.0
Punith Shenoy, 5 November 2019,This is an all-arounder.You won't find any area where OnePlus has not checked the box.• Excellent performance.• Camera good enough.• Loved the dual dolby speakers. You can feel the surround sound without headphones. Awesome for watching movies and videos.• I have always loved OnePlus design and this doesn't disappoint a bit. Premium feel in the hands.• Display is fantastic for 4k content.• Battery has been good until now. Battery discharge a bit faster when refresh rate is 90hz ( Expected  needs to be compromised somewhere :P )• Only con I have is missing headphone jack. I had recently purchased Sony extrabass wired earphones for my OnePlus 5 ( I know converter can be used but couldn't find one for now). Should invest more on Bluetooth headphones.,0,Beast !,5.0
Shivam, 7 October 2019,I love this phone for its fluid OS and Performance only problem is it's battery life. It drains faster than other phones with similar battery size. Altho this is compensated by the super fast charging but still it's an issue worth mentioning.Camera is great tho can be improved. I use google cam on my device.Hope they fix all this in future Updates.,One,Great Phone Avg Battery Life,4.0
Vineet, 3 November 2019,The phone at 90Hz display setting is a treat to use. Oxygen OS has a number of settings to customize the overall look and feel of the phone. The camera lens setup at the back is an on-off for most given the horizontal lineup inside a circular disc. A phone with 8GB RAM running at 90Hz display deserves more battery juice than the current 3800 mah although the warp charge does a fairly speedy job to charge the phone. Overall a very good phone to watch videos at high definition game at high resolution and click good pictures only let down by the relatively lower battery backup.,0,Experience 90Hz display!,5.0
Amazon Customer, 8 October 2019,So had to choose between this phone and the rog2. Both are excellent phones and was a tough choice. Flipkart having less availability of rog2 made the choice easier in the end :) moreover one plus is now a trusted brand name so that helps. Its pros - lighter trustworthy brand quicker charging speed more professional look better camera macro lens!Cons - 3800mah battery compared to 6k mah of rog2. Did not expect the phone's battery to really last more than 12 hours which is fine since we all charge at night atleast however to my surprise it's been lasting for more than a day!Plus the warp charge is indeed as good as marketed got around 75% in half hour from 1%.The fingerprint reader and camera are very good having no issues. The 90hz refresh rate is probably just a new marketing thing to attract better prices. Even an above average user won't notice it. Not sure what 1 has to do to even notice it lol. The screen quality is awesome indeed though.Hope these details help.,0,Awesome phone,5.0
Suman Gupta, 22 October 2019,Well One of the best decision to invest money in electronics. This phone is really a masterpiece. What a build quality what a camera what a surround sound what an amoled screen what a great software optimization of Android. It is impossible to find a phone with this level of performance in this price bracket. I ordered it the moment it launched and never felt it was a wrong decision. 400000 256 GB. What else you want. Now my phone has double the Ram my laptop has. Do you belive that? The 90 hz display is awesome..Great job oneplus as always. Keep it up.Just onething you should change. This  phone is not a mid range phone. So please make sure to put a headset inside it. That will be a bang for the buck.,0,Best Phone your hard earn money can buy.,5.0
harshil gupta, 24 January 2020,I am very unsatisfied with this phone some applications are not working with mobile data while they are working fine with wifi connection. I already replaced my first OnePlus 7t device becuause of the same issue and bought a new one and after approx 2 month same issue is emerging in this device also... I already made complaints regarding this issue and they provide some technical solutions but still it's useless. Now they are saying we will pic your phone and upgrade your device software it means if i give them my phone then i have to wait for some days to get my phone back till i have to live without phone...Just a worst device i ever used if u are thinking to buy it please go for some other oneplus device or on other brand,0,Worst device OnePlus 7t,1.0
NITIN TKB, 3 October 2019,I'm very much in awwwee.... After using this mobile I love the way this mobile sees(Camera) everything.. I mean you just have to point it at what you want to capture & click it. This is for Pro's & as well as for beginners.The Macro shots are something that is amazing the light collected by the sensor is great for low light photography. Overall this is a very beautiful phone to have your hands-on.Just 1 issue I have is I didn't get a 3.5mm to type C connector.That's it thank you :),One,One HECK of a phone!,5.0

Rocky, 8 May 2020,There is a lot of difference in performance and quality of product from expectations that have pop up due to name of 1+ phones.I have purchased two both from Amazon within 1 year. Screen and display quality is not even close to expectations. Both phones are non functional as of now.,0,Questionable display of 1+7t and 6 t,2.0
Amazon Customer, 18 October 2019,OMG!!!!!!! This is no doubt the best smartphone one can have in the 40k price bracket. The display battery life UI smoothness because of 90Hz and the camera all will give you more than the value for money. Though it might it a while for me to get used to the bigger screen size since I have switched from I phone 7. One plus 7t still fits comfortable in my hand.It has some crazy additional features like Zen mode reading mode and the oxygen OS customization is just beautiful.Even after a good days use with heavy media consumption and moderate gaming I still have enough juice left to last 3-4 hours.This is a must buy,0,God like speed. AMAZING features!!!!! Paisa vasool,5.0
neeraj madan, 12 December 2019,If you want Quality buy iPhone. If you want features at budgeted price VIVO OPPO REDMI MI will do. Proper balanced phone SAMSUNG with service back up.I fail to see any merit buying one plus though I took the plunge and bought it. Phone fails interminnetly with camera failing phone stalling and slowness. Even rebooting and factory reset doesn't help. With no proper service backup in a metro like Bangalore THIS phone is simply not worth it. Waste of money- Typical CHINESE glam shot works as long it can and then its sad story.,0,CHINESE it is. Not worth a penny more then its Chini siblings.,1.0
Rohit Gaur, 13 October 2019,I purchased this phone on 29th September and thus this is a review after using it for about 10 days.Pros-1. Camera-Macro mode is love!2. Display- Fluidic display which everyone will love3. Processor and RAM- These make the phone superfast4. Service- I received a defective product which the service center replaced in just one day! Overall happy with the service they were prompt and responsive.5. Charging- Warp charge 30T is the best! Charges 3800mah battery in less than an hour.6. Stereo speakers- loud and crisp7. Notch is little bit smaller than OnePlus 7Cons-1. Battery- Not upto expectations earlier I owned OP5 which had 3300 mah battery which later more than a day on average usage. But this phone just clears 24 hrs on moderate usage and if we play games like pubg it just can't reach 24 hrs. Though I get about 5-6 hrs screen on time which is good.2. No 3.5mm jack- It can be a con for this device but I assure you that listening from type-c is much better than the jack try to experience it yourself.Overall if you want a phone like OP7pro/7Tpro at less price and can give up curved display I think this can be the best choice. Just go for it.,0,OnePlus 7T-90Hz awesomeness!,5.0
Raghav Jasuja, 27 October 2019,I've been using this phone for a month now and I can rightly say that this is the best phone I've ever used. The processor is extremely fast and I can switch apps easily. Camera is also amazing even in night mode. Fingerprint reader is extremely fast. The only con I found is that battery could last longer. It lasts an entire day with average to heavy use but still OnePlus could have done better. Also it lacks notification light.,One,Best phone under 40000 price range,5.0

Arnab Batabyal, 25 October 2019,Good speaker.Good camera macro specially and night mode.Good display.Oxygen OS is great as you already know.Gamming is good but may increase temperature some times.Battery drains fast if screen refresh rate is set up to 90hrzs.Fast charging can do a full charge within 20 min I guess.The given silicon cover will become red from transparent eventually.No 3.5 mm headfone jack so bought a Bluetooth one.Amazon exchange policy is bad. Delivery boy came and can not scan the barcode told that will be back in one hour. After getting out of my house cancelled the order immediately. Amazon customer care is dumb. Say can not help with that any way. Raised a complaint but never get back to me. So have to order again with 3000 extra bucks.,0,Good product but Amazon exchange policy is very bad.,5.0
Indranil Saha, 24 October 2019,Fantastic purchase at this price. The OnePlus 7t has a mesmerizing design silky smooth performance with a 90Hz display stellar camera which has the potential to be further improved with updates and above average battery life which can last you a full 1 day and then some more with a solid 6hrs SOT. The notch is a bit of a bother but you tend to get used to it although I found Netflix and Asphalt 9 ran with a black bar eliminating the notch. I don't know if this is the case with others also. Summing it up at the price of 40k for the higher 256 gig version you won't find a better deal. Period. Grab it while you can. And did I mention that it also comes preloaded with the spanking new Android 10?,0,Awesome value and top class design. The design befits a 50k smartphone.,5.0
Nikhil, 19 April 2020,This phone has the best features.It is mentioned that the battery life is 3800mAh you may think that it is less when compared to other flagsgips. But don't think it is less. It is more than enough for day to day life. This charges very fast as mentioned (0-100% in 40min).Camera is also excellent. You may need some software for converting videos before sending to other devices. This is because in this device you will get 1080p4k but if some play the same in other device it will be of low quality. Don't think your phone has some problem. That's all.,0,Best features at this price,5.0

mahesh, 4 October 2019,I once had Samsung Galaxy s2 and felt not to spend too much on smart phones and spending under 15k is more than sufficient. budget phones will work for some time and later issues arose like poor vendor support camera quality battery issues etc. As some say one shouldn't  expect best at lower prices.

Battery life is very good easily getting 8-9 hrs SOT on wifi and 6 hrs on mobile data standby time also good all these sot on 90hz and mobile data always on.7. Wide angle camera and night sight camera is additional advantage night sight is comparable to pixel.8. Haptic feedback is very good.9. Performance at top notch with 855 plus.10. Multitasking great with 8gb ram.Cons:1. Using pixel 2xl from long time potrait mode is not as good as pixel infact it is best on pixel.2. Ambient display is having bug in most of the devices tap to wake and lift to wake not working lot of time one plus please provide fix for this.Tips: use GCam for best camera results.Final verdict: Dont think and just get one plus 7t if having 38k budget.,0,Best Value for money one plus till date.,5.0

But when i checked the un boxing video in youtube they have averthing imcluding the tempered glass and the head phone and backcase. It is a huge box. I think these sellers are taking off those accesseries and sent only the phone piece. I would suggest to walk in to the store and get one so that u can bargain and get some free accessories.

Amazon Customer, 12 January 2020,Build quality is top notch..Feels premium in hand. Camera unit is pretty amazing in that prize range epically nightscape works like magic!. Snapdragon 855+ processor is crazy fast pairing this with adreno 640 GPU and 8 gigs of ram any game available for android runs flawlessly and fluidly . For dynamic sund lovers the stereo speakers work really fine. Haptic motor is improved and you feel that while using the phone. Fingerprint reader situated under the screen is the fastest fingerprint reader in under screen fingerprint readers on different phones but comparing this with physical fingerprint sensors is not fair.And finally coming to its 90hz panel..its so good that once you get used to the fluidity of this panel you won't see anything on phone having frame rate below 90hz the experience is magical. As a bonus you get warp charger 30T which is 18% faster than one plus 7 pro its really handy to juice up your phone rapidly. To sum this up...A phone with 90hz panel fastest processor by snapdragon stereo speakers quality camera setup warp charger..This is the best option at this price point..Kudos!,0,Amazing experience!!,5.0

Aabacus, 12 December 2019,I had to resend the first device as its proximity sensor was not working properly. Amazon did replace the hand set on time- thanks Amazon.

David panwar, 23 November 2019,Its been a week since i have been using the one plus 7t and the moment you will tlbe using this device you feel the premium screen is just flawless as smooth as butter the camera looks like pro and if you can learn to use it in pro mode you can use it as a compact dslr i bought it under 30k using exchange so its pretty awesome deal for me just one lag the battery you can't expect much from a 3800mah battery but the charger kill it 70% in just 30 minutes so its best.Only the issue is after market vlaue price of one plus they are the fastest depriciating smartphones so if you are planning to buy it use it atleast for 2 years and you wont face any issues,0,Ferarri in price of Ford.,4.0
Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, 4 March 2020,I'm reviewing this product after using 3 months. I think it's more than enough time to understand a device in detail. Now below are my experience:1. Built quality: Superb. It really looks great when you use.2. Display: Full HD+ and sharp enough to enjoy any content.3. Performance: Very good.4. Camera: Good but it can be better. All capable hardware is there for best performance. Only matter of software update for improvement.5. Battery: It's easily 1 day material for moderate user if display set at 60 Hz refresh rate. At 90 Hz you may get hour or hour & half less compared to set at 60 Hz. Charges rapidly with Warp T charger.,0,A very good performing phone with good camera.,4.0
ANUPAM, 4 November 2019,Amazon is making full to people they offer me an emi plan on the product now i got some extra charge in my statment and when i spok to bank they are telling me talk to amazon and when i contacted amazon.An new story in place they are telling me they dont know any thing i sups to check with my bank.When they want to sale the product they keep the offer on website and when its come to solution they are running from this thing.In this i am paying 700 to 800 rs extra on the product.That means Amazon is doing fraud with all the customer.If i am wrong everyone who had purchased product on emi can check this thing.I checked and i have proof for that as well.,0,""" Amazon is fraud "" "" dont buy any thing from this website on emi or any bank offer """,5.0

naveen k, 9 November 2019,Bought this phone two days back. Performance is ok so far except the few issues I already faced in the 2 days:1) battery gets charged quite quickly but gets drained quite quicker compared to the redmi phone I was using earlier.2) there is one functionality of ambient display which does not work. I started searching for solution and realised there are so many people facing the same issue. Multiple videos are there on YouTube as well highlighting the same issue but there is no solution. It works as per its mood. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't.,0,Ok phone but a few glitches,4.0
yoga, 28 November 2019,The product is not that great. Initial days I found extraordinary in performance. Over the time getting down. It Hangs. YES IT IS.

Bony, 5 February 2020,Coming from Redmi Note 7 Here is my Review after using it for 10 days.Positive--1. WARP Charging is just awesome. Never charged it for more than 40 Mins.2. I don't know about 90Hz Screen but UI is Simple and butter smooth.3. SP 855 Processor is blazing fast. No lag at all.Negative--1. No 3.5 mm Port and Dongle is not provided. So a BIG ZERO to ONEPLUS TEAM for that.2. I was expecting a better display at this price. A 2k amoled screen would have better.3. Android 10 is plane boring. OnePlus should have added more features.  So overall a decent Phone but should have priced @ 30k.,0,I have Settled for now.,4.0
JOYAL, 11 October 2019,I was a motoe4plus user when I switched to 7t.The 7t comes wt top specs.1)Battery LifeAs a student for my usage the phone lasts one day.There is slight decrease in battery life when we switch to 90hz but still it lasts me a day.And wrap charge is Super fast.One more thing as it charges fast it doesn't mean it will drain fastly.There is a slight heating issue but I think an update can fix it2)DisplayOne of the best Display in a smartphone.My friends were really stunned by the quality of it. And the 90hz is the best feature.3)CameraThe triple camera is much better.I compared it wt Samsung s10 of my friend and it's much better.THE VIDEO STABILIZATION IS THE BEST IN ANY SMARTPHONE.The front camera has a more natural tone.Overall I give 5/5 for stabilization and 4/5 for quality.Night mode is also good4)SpecsTop classOverall it's a must buy phone,0,A must buy phone under 40k price range,5.0
Dr. Pandit, 16 February 2020,Expected a little better battery life. One of my friends and I bought the phone almost together with a difference of 5 days. The battery life in my phone is much lower as compared to his' although his usage is much more than mine. If you are upgrading the phone frommlets say One plus 5 then I guess it will be a major upgrade in terms of screen display camera overall feel of the phone barring the battery life. Battery is worse than even OnePlus 5.,0,Nice phone Ok battery,4.0

Basil Ikbal, 24 January 2020,There’s no need of writing a review. It’s well known that Oneplus gives us great phones every year. And this time too they gave us a perfect phone at a decent price. Gives almost all features of Oneplus 7T pro. So if you have fund issues to buy pro then don’t hesitate to buy 7T. Only problem that caused me is the camera shape. I personally feel that the circular shape looks a bit too bulky for the phone ( still not a very big issue). But without that I give a 11/10 for this.,0,Name is Oneplus so go for it!!,5.0
Kishan Modha, 27 December 2019,A day Old and what I observe:1. Excellent Battery Life.2. Processor works too much faster as a fluid.3. Camera is also best.4.

SUMAN KUMAR, 13 November 2019,In a simple word phone is good but  camera isn't as good as price we are getting. Lack of headphone jack and average battery life and there are lots of bugs in software when I am writing this like ram managment (doesn't hold any app more than 2 min.) App crashes and the camera bump is really big and dump but it doesn't look as bad as we think etc. After that everything is great.,One,Average camera but after that great.,4.0

Rohit S., 23 January 2020,They should have given a higher pixel density screen with curved display like pro version to make it be 'Value for Money'.Difference of RAM and a higher memory with pop up selfie would have been 'the extra' for pro users.There is no earphone with c-type connector (ofcourse of good quality) which makes it less value for money.And yes this too hangs at times so I do not totally agree with 'the speed' factor of One Plus.Honestly I didn't find even iPhone X woth or Latest galaxy worth the price tags.I feel Samsung's Note series is ok but even that too should be priced  a little lower.,0,Flagship's Honest Reviews,4.0
Eshwar iyer, 5 October 2019,Phone is good and very light and sleek model.

Raminder Singh, 22 May 2020,Worst experience with one plus 7T phone. I recommend to users don't spoil your money for buying this product.

Once again say that before buying this phone just take feedback from users,One,Worst Phone in segment of high price,1.0
Ibin Joy, 30 June 2020,It's a good and premium smartphone. I would say almost all features are built on it.  Performance is exceptional.

Roscoe, 3 June 2020,I just got the phone delivered today. Nd sincerely speaking im quite disappointed with the battery life. Its just too bad for the price tag of this phone. But considering the amazing charger it has i dont feel much of a problem. The cameras were decent tbh. Not too awesome. And not too bad. This handset is just awesome for gaming. You find no lags at alll throughout. But what im gonna say is gonna let you down. This phone heats up big time. Ive never heard of this from any of the YouTube reviewers. But sadly this is the truth. And I doubt very much if this is a faulty piece if yes then i would like you to get this device replaced for a properly working device,0,Ups and Downs,4.0
anil, 21 January 2020,Hi TeamI bought a One Plus 7T handset on date 29th dec.  I have recently start experiencing some issues with my phone. The phone got switched off while it was still completely charged. I had to take it to the service center. Though they were able to start it I am still experiencing some issues like the phone hanging while use and unclarity and echos while on calls. Are these known issues with 1+7T handsets or probably I could have gotten a defective piece? Please can you help with getting these issues fixed or getting the handset replaced? I would be very grateful if you could help me with this?Thanks,0,Not satisfied with this handset..,1.0

Dr Sarbani Bhaumik, 22 March 2020,Undoubtly super device. Camera the biggest improvement in comparison to all OP devices. Strong advice dnt go for OP7 PRO. Go for OP7T you will never regret.

Saravanesh J B, 10 October 2019,It's been a week since I started using this product. Not a pro in analysing and posting reviews for a smartphone but from my weeks experience the phone is performing really good. It hanged once while clicking pics but did not see it recur later on.30w Warp charge is a huge positive for this mobile the mobile gets charged up in no time. From my experience it took close to 45 min to charge from 18 to 100 percent. Camera is pretty good as well no issues with it. When it comes to battery life I was easily able to get a day and a half on normal usage(Note: I'm not a gaming person so this view might be subjective)Definitely would recommend this product.,0,All good with this 7t,5.0
Harsha, 12 July 2020,After 60 days of usage my reviewCamera is OKthe cam sometimes adds more colours to the frame Install GCAM and everything is fineBattery life GOOD but if you are a gamer and early streamer you need to charge and play screen time was  5-6hrs on 90hzBest OS No need to mentionI recommend to buy OnePlus bullets Z if you are a gamer low latency during pubg0-100 charge in 80mins,0,Best budget flagship but a CHINESE product,4.0
Tamilmani T, 16 January 2020,Oneplus is known for its high end flagship specifications user-friendly features and competitive price. There is no doubt that Oneplus has proved it again with 7T.The Oxygen OS looks extra snappy with the Andriod 10 flavor. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast as well. Battery is better and can still be optimized. Thanks to the warp charge 30T tech for its unprecedented charging time.Undoubtedly camera department needs improvement as Oneplus is no more a flagship killer rather a flagship itself :).,0,Best feature packed phone in this price tag,5.0

Abhishek Khatod, 4 November 2019,It's been a month now since I am using this phone.. So few points worth noticing are :Camera quality : 4.5/5 (though size of the pics are not more than 4mb at max but still they look grt on your phone)Finger print : sensor seems like lagging a bit but that is ignorable so overall 4/5 for thatBattery life : 3.5/5 at max it will last one day but if usage is heavy it might not last more than 3/4th of the dayGaming experience : 5/5 graphics are amazing.. You won't regret playing any games on this.90hz feature : you will definitely feel a difference in using 90hz feature.. Switching between apps is like flowing water.. 5/5 for that tooAdding few clicks taken by this phone..Hope this helps 😊Overall if budget is around 35-38 and want a triple camera along with heavy duty phone you must go for this 😊 cheers,0,One plus never disappoints.. 😊,4.0
Zaran Momaya, 4 March 2020,Charger is amazing. Charges so quickly that there is no other charger which matches the one available in oneplus T box. Fingerprint sensor should have been better.

MadhuAnup, 4 July 2020,I bought this phone after a long dilemma of it being Chinese phone. I was stuck between OnePlus 7t and samsung A71. But finally I chose this phone as specifications wise Samsung A71 was no where near it.I after using for 2 days I can say that it was a good choice. There are plenty of reviews about this phone and they are not wrong in saying that it is a great ohone in terms of speed camera display and battery life.My brother is using OnePlus 6t for around 2 years and his phone still is as good as new.

Vijayanand N., 5 October 2019,I was a fan of Xiaomi have used Mi3 Mi5 Redmi not 5 Pro and than shifted to OnePlus 6 Loved Xiaomi because of MIUI compared to stock ROMs but after using OnePlus 6 became a fan of Oxygen OS have much better features than MIUI. Now let's come to OnePlus 7tHave read many reviews on draining of battery heating up of device which I don't agree on both Mobile gets heat up only while charging.. battery I got for full day with extensive usage.

Anubha chakraborty, 11 July 2020,M using this phone from last 15 days and according to me it's worth it! No doubt OnePlus is again proving itself with all the expectations bt in some point the fingerprint sensor didnt matched as perfect as my expectation bt it's smooth enough! It's not noticeable at all! The camera quality is upto another level. Both the front and back are above expectations! And battery life is also perfect! The phone itself gives a premium look and it's easy to handle as its having slim slides!If u are planning for buying this phone!

Might not matter for many.I've requested for a replacement and hopefully will get it in a day or two.

This phone is a clear winner in all the departments ! Say it Camera Gaming Multitasking Battery life its all top notch...The only thing I feel is this phone could have been powered by 4000+ mAH battery which is 3800 as of now.With OnePlus fast charging it would have been cherry on top of the 🍰Other than that its a BEAST,0,Oneplus BEAST !!!,4.0

Customer except DSLR quality picture from one plus 7t.,One,Detailing missing in camara picture quality. Need some improvement like DSLR picture.,3.0
Ayush Srivastava, 3 October 2019,It is the best phone till date. It is so smooth in every tasks.PROS:1) Display: Display is buttery smooth. 90Hz display gives you a smooth performance.2) Battery: Battery is not so bad as it is being said by reviewers as it is giving me around 1 and half day of battery life in aggressive usage. I play heavy games a lot like pubg and Call of duty. And still the performance is nice.3) Camera: Believe me the pictures coming out from this phone are perfect. I am a professional photographer and i am pretty impressed by the performance of the camera.And the videos are also good and so are slomos.4) Sound: Stereo speakers of this phone are insane. I have used many stereo speaker smartphones and i am telling you the speakers from this device gives better sound.5) Charging: The phone charges from 0-100% in 60-70 mins. What else you want now?CONS:1) No 3.5mm jack as you all know. And the company is not providing any 3.5mm to type-c connector.2) No IP Rating. However the company said that the phone can bear water splashes but the certification is what makes us comfortable.3) No wireless Charging. The device has a glass back but then too there is no wireless charging.But these cons are not a deal breaker.Note: At this price range OnePlus 7T is a great deal. Go for it blindly.,0,Best smartphone in the market.,5.0
Amazon Customer, 20 November 2019,I have been using various other phones for the past 10yrs...This is the first time I am using a ONEPLUS model...and I am in love with this  ...Yes  I feel they could have improved the battery level but still the 90htz display camera qualitysensor  etc doesn't give any excuse.....if u feel battery is little weak according to our standard we can switch back to 60htz display in settings which improves batter life ...I will give 4.8/5 for this product where .2 is deducted for battery life...NB: one plus doesn't provide audio jack...they should rethink for providing free Bluetooth one plus ear phones with this device as we are paying this much amount...,0,One Plus 7t,5.0
Arun Sagar S K, 10 November 2019,Its a performance beast. No question abt that. I just wish it had a better battery to go with other hardware. Mind you the battery backup is not bad by any means. But i wont say its better than avg. Camera is good too So long as you r not comparing it with the latest iphones or samsung and huawei flagships.Awesome screen and sound quality. Though i would have preferred a bit more bass from the pair of speakers.,0,Beast of a phone with an ok ish power source,5.0
Vyankatesh Gupta, 7 January 2020,Oneplus gives you premium quality phones in Android. Camera is best. Battery life is okay lasts for whole day but on very heavy work need to charge. Charging is just awesome 45min whole phn is charged. Bulit quality is pretty good. If you are thinking for android go for oneplus rather than expensive note phones. Oneplus always gives you update on time to time so no worry that your phone become old. I used oneplus 6 till it is getting updates. Unfortunately i lost it. I trust oneplus so again going for it. Oneplus is best for android no one can beat it. Really happy with my new oneplus 7t😀😀,0,Awesome product,5.0

But after seeing this beauty and a after seeing so much great reviews I finally got this phone and I think I've made a good decision ever. I received it in 1 day delivery 😄 which is the best part...

aakib, 11 October 2019,One star for Amazon worst delivery service 3 star for oneplus 7t..OnePlus 7t phone is very good it is very good its camera quality is also very good and what is the enjoyment of the Oxygen OS so the phone is very good overall there is no shortage in this I had the desire to complete this phone The Amazon delivery service  worst  too much delayThese phones were purchased in the Amazon Great Indian Festival.All these fine ok the phone is  very good I'm very happy.Very disappointed for one thingAudio Jack not available in the phoneNo worry OnePlus was found in the name of the Flagship Killer when you came to Market  Now oneplus's own flagship phone come to the market.At least in Apple's XR include ear buds in the box for freeYou had to take some Option to For the EarphoneWhile you are charging a Flagship phone price but you are not giving us the complete accessories.Above all you are competing with Apple and Samsung.  At least Apple gives full accessories in exchange for the price it takes.I think oneplus have to provide complete accessories in the box.,0,The Amazon delivery service is worst too late,3.0
Sourabh Das, 29 February 2020,Finally got my hands on this beauty.This is my first OnePlus smartphone.

Amazon Customer, 9 February 2020,One of the basic operations we do is connect via Hotspot.  However when connected via hotspot if a call comes then the hotspot disconnects which is very very disappointing. I had used a Moto G followed by Apple iPhone XS & never faced this issue.

Saurav, 4 February 2020,Fingerprint reader is very fast camera qualitu is awesome with all the features from nightscape to macro mode works really well battery life is descent one plus should provide more powerful battery with this flagship device but 30t warp charger charges its very fast so you won't really feel anoying and i too hardly notices when my battery gets full within 40mins...thnx feel free to buy this amazing phone . Major missing is that headphone jack but once youll start using this fastest device youll forget about the 3.5mm jack.I am also shareing few camera samples which i have shot on different light conditions and in different modes have a look on that.

Arpan, 24 January 2020,A wonderful Phone which excels in every aspect be it hardware software connectivity looks & others.Battery is the only department where I am not extremely happy with this phone as it only lasts from a full charge to 10% from morning till evening. If I use it slightly more I would need to charge it once during the office hours as well so as to have sufficient charge while travelling back to home. But all this is balanced by the Fast Warp Charging Feature pretty well.,0,Best Mobile Phone of the current times,5.0

Kunal Vachhani, 20 October 2019,I received One Plus 7T (8gb 256gb) 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 daysFirstly kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.

Go for it.,0,Excellent phone  top notch features at an fraction of cost,5.0
Anil, 24 February 2020,Exceptional! Got it in 30.5K and believe me in this price segment this is simply the best.Pros:Blazingly fast processor fingerprint scanner and Face unlock.Dolby atmos surround sound.Ram and memory management is pretty good.Triple camera lens provides you the best shots.90hz screen refresh rate gives you ultra smooth touch experience.Best for heavy users and gamers.Cons:The display could have been brighter on the lower side if you use it in outside sunny daytime.Lacks IP rating and 3.5 mm headphone jack.Battery gives you just above average performance but the lightning fast 30w warp charger fills it in just an hour.,0,A beast!,5.0

Gautam Buragohain, 9 January 2020, We all know about Oneplus and it's performance. At the price range it's the best. Yeah. I didn't like the camera design but now I'm kinda getting a hang of it. Now I knida like it. The camera is decent. The phone is way fast of course with the snapdragon 855 plus. Finger print unlock best in the class and face unlock is blazing fast. Fastest among all i have used. But I do feel the battery capacity much have been a little bigger it's only 3800 but again you get the warp charger. So it cover up this con. And love the colour even. An the Fluid amoled display with the 90hz refresh rate brightness is good for outdoors even goes up to 1000 nits. It's sick overall. So Never Settle it is.,0,Never Settle! Hell yeah!,5.0

sakabda, 1 June 2020,The first thing that will strike you is the speed of the phone there is absolutely no lag even when operating multiple applications. The on screen fingerprint reader is just amazing. The screen is super vibrant. The only flip side is it's battery and in some respect it's camera. But please don't be mistaken even with its shortcommings it can very well compete with top of the line flagship phones. It's a great deal at this price point when you consider it's specifications.,0,Ultimate flagship killer,5.0

Samdarshi Barthwal, 6 November 2019,Overall phone is Excellent. Battery. Life is very poor at this price range and for this brand. 4 to 5 hours regular use will drain out the whole battery from 100 to zero. I hope OnePlus team will resolve this issue soon.Now after setting display on natural view from advanced amoled view and refresh rate from 90 to 60 htz it's battery time has been improved from 5 hrs to nearly 8 to 9 hrs very safely from 100 to 10%.,0,Excellent phone OP7t at this price with very poor battery life.,4.0
RITIKA BATRA, 27 January 2020,My feedback is about the ergonomics and design of this model. The proportion of the screen size is really abrupt. They have not increased both width and height of the phone rather only the height. This makes it an awkward proportion to use does not enlarge the viewed content whether videos or other content and feels rather uncomfortable if the purpose is to go for a slightly bigger screen. So while it has a particular rise in screen size compared to previous models it doesn't actually function and rather is only misguiding.,0,Not the right proportion of screen size misleading,1.0
Shubham Bhargad, 21 November 2019,Battery life - not enough to last more than half a day on a single 4G sim. Without extensive gaming.Heating issues - Even on simple facebook  YouTube apps the phone gets tremendously heated. Leaving aside the gaming apps .Fingerprint scanner - Not fast enough doesnt read the edges properly doesn't identify the fingerprint 4 out of 10 times.Gesture function- Misbehaves; like for the home or or recent apps and sometimes even for the back function.Camera quality - Nowhere near the hype led by oneplus of a 48 mp rear camera. Photos are not color cordinated sharpness in the skin tone always missing.Not worth the price. No smooth experience as a smart phone . As a previous Owner of a oneplus 5t  I didn't like this new oneplus 7t as an upgrade & Dont recommend it to anyone.,0,My Oneplus 7t (8/128) review after 10 days of purchasing.,2.0

kunal maheshwari, 24 May 2020,The overall performance of the phone is outstanding but battery life is very low would say 6 hrs of time if your use for streaming or surfing. Gaming is awesome but drain a lot of battery. Camera quality is super and super macro mode really surprised me. Fingerprint sensor is ok wouldn't it is fast but is reliable but can go for really fast face unlock( i personally don't prefer it though). I have used the phone for a week now and would say a must buy phone if the budget is around 30k or even 40k. Also would mention the sound quality it offers just amazing.,0,Great phone. Minor drawbacks but won't change the decision,4.0

The lower priced mobiles of other companies have much better performance. Regretting why I didn't return it during first ten days of purchase.

Kapil P., 8 December 2019,An awesome phone no words to describe. The hardware is top notch the software is smooth.

Macro mode is my fav thing in the phone. And 90 Hrz display feels like you are moving finger on butter.Only thing I didn't like is battery because of 90 Hrz display it drains faster but for that OnePlus gave us fast charger which will charge your phone in minutes so no complains for that.,0,Beast unlocked,5.0
dipank31, 20 November 2019,1)Camera's are good. But can't compare to an Ip hone XR or Iphone 11 and above. So it needs to get improved.2) Battery is average. It would barely last for a day. But charging is fast like 0-70 in just 30mins. So that helps.3) Display is great. 90Hz feels really smooth. Colour Accuracy is great too.4) Software experience doesn't need to be explained.

ks, 4 March 2020,It's a very poor experience with amezon.I complained about one plus 7T  mobile handset that I received. Handset is overheating till 45 degree centigrade. But Amezon person says that it is a usual temperature and it's not abnormal.I requested them for return the device but they are not ready for it.As its not easy for me to handle the hot phone i requested them to return.

Devi d., 25 January 2020,I got the phone just two days back and when I powered it on for the first time the phone was way to hot to actually take a call. However i waited and wanted to check for atleast a day of usage. Heating issue is again happening on the second day especially near the top speaker area which I can feel while talking. Not sure whether some update is require or it's actually a problem. I suspect while playing heavy games it may go more high. So as of now I can say this phone has some heating issue.

Gowtham, 6 March 2020,Best bet for the money.Hardware : Best camera. Night photos are amazing. 90hz screen gives good user experience. Smooth as butter. But the catch is battery drains fast if 90hz mode is enabled. Fingerprint sensor is very responsive. Screen is kindof allergic to sweat especially if put in pocket.Software: Android 10 + Oxygen OS doing its job very well. Best ever user interface experience. Clean and simple.

Supreeth, 2 December 2019,I was using Oneplus3 for around 3 years and 6 months and had to upgrade. The pricing on the 7T was a little dissappointing so explored various other options. Could Never Settle for any of them because they lacked some or the other thing. This is a brilliant phone with amazing performance. UI and UX are 2 of the most important things for me and OP7T does all justice here.Oxygen OS on Android 10 beats all other Android UIs hands down.The power of SD 855+ and Adreno 640 enhances your UX may it be multitasking or gaming.,0,Once oneplus always one plus,5.0

Rajat Uppal, 2 October 2019,I have been buying oneplus' phones before it became a well known brand. There is a certain peace of mind that comes with these devices which other brands cannot match not even google itself. This phone continues everything that oneplus has been providing to its users for more than 5 years. It's crazy fast super smooth and really really beautiful to look at especially the frosted grey colour. It is a proper update from it's predecessor oneplus 7 and the screen itself is worth the extra money spent. As such there are no cons for me although I will wait and see how well the battery performs thanks to 90 hz display.In short you can order it with your eyes closed😊,0,No-nonsense phone!!,5.0
Ankit Singh, 14 November 2019,Its smooth as hell. You click it and it respond. I switched from iphone 7 plus to oneplus and till date after use of 1 months am satisfied with my choice. It gives you premium feel and performance every task. Nice product with quality.,0,Beast mode,5.0

rj, 14 October 2019,Buttery smooth display. Camera quality good but can be better in low light.Few things to improve in OnePlus sw: oneplus messaging does not have swipe delete option of sms messages.

Vaibhav Bhojwani, 2 October 2019,Received the phone today at 8AM and tested it till writing this review at 9.45PM. The box is new design long and red. The phone is immaculately packed. The blue colour I had ordered was amazing beyond words. The camera quality is better than any high end phone available in the market as on date. Even the low light pics were awesome. The Dolby speakers system give a deep and Crystal sound to songs. With android 10 it is a breeze to work on. No lag is visible in any working app be it heavy gaming or office apps. This is a steal in terms of camera sound top notch design and best features in the market.

Purushothaman , 7 October 2019,One of the Best Phone in Android.Camera quality awesome. Pictures capture with full details.

mohini kale, 19 June 2020,Keeping the camera and battery life aside the main part that the device heats up a lot. This happens while charging the phone while on the call and also while playing a game. I understand its normal that the device heats up but not immediately as soon as you buy the phone which is new and packed and did not have to privilege to enjoy feel good about the product.
